Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
I believe we share an art instructor
Tons
What crap?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
They do not!
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Queen Harry?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like you care.
What?
You set me up.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Why?
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
How many people go here?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
It's her favorite band.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Not at all
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
My mission in life.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
And why would I do that?
I know, just let me sleep
Sure, I do
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
I hate him.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
You know what they say
Do what?
I'm gettin' there
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Acting the way we do.
For. . . ?
Hearsay.
No one else knows
No what?
Why not?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Is that right?
Because I like to torture you.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
I thought you were punishing me.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Parts of it.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Hi.
Right.
What?
We're your guys.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
What's to discuss?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Tumescent!
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
I am, Your Eminence
Excellency, you are right.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
... for a commoner?
What...?  Do I have so many already?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Chief says -- he has a God.
You did the same to your God!
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
Damn God!
I knew you would.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
What did they say about Granada before today?
Come over here.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Where are we going?
You bring the cigarettes?
No.  No way.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Yes, I considered it.
No.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'll get my clothes.
Pouring it out!
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
But Chief?  Over this??
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Vodka tonic.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
What are you saying?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Better than one.
I'm on duty.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Then do it, asshole.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Hey.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
I'm not.
Could be Leon's.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Tonight.
Yeah.  I promise.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Good idea!
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Did you hurt her?
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You want the tape?  There it is!
Alright.  Go ahead.
That's what it looks like to me.
No way!  He's mine!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Clean?
He knew all along.
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Not good.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
She's wonderful.
Sure, what is it?
No. I never did, either.
I guess it isn't.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes.
And don't you worry about it.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, what is it?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
In three days, darling, I hope.
She's in the bathroom.
Thank you, Daddy.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Well, where are all of you off to?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Great, just great.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
No chance.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Thank you.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
What are you talkin' about?
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
How much?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
You stay with me...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
What about Ganz?
You sure that's the reason?
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Luther's on the move...
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Yeah, I read the report...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
I lost them, that's what happened.
Yeah.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Shit.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
What?
What's wrong with that?
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Hiya, kid.
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
So what?
That's no bull.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Yeah, old times.
Sure, right.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Naw, right here's okay.
This ain't a credit business.
You know exactly where they are!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
I brought the girl remember?
So you do know her.
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Good luck..
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
How do I look?
Leeloo..
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Yeah, very big, a giant.
He's on vacation.
I'll be right back.
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Just one... why me?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm so tired...
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Wonderful!
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Options.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
I don't know what to say
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What can I do for you today?
Hmm.
Machine.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Machine's in?
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
What are you... ?
I remember him.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
What do you want?
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
You enjoy it?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Don't think I won't.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Yeah... guess so.
Pardon me?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Three, four years.
There's not much illegal.
How much?
Sounds good, pops.
Child pornography.
Twenty-five.
I don't know, where are yours?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
Specialty product.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I told you I can't, not yet.
You're joking.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I hope it's nothing serious.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Yes.
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
I can't find him.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
We have matching luggage.
That obvious, huh?
You're his sister, right?
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Extra money, huh?
Three days.
Then what else can we do?
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Earth to Alice...
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
It's okay, Dan
She doesn't want me around
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Since my little girl became a mom...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Well we gotta do something!
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
But I've seen her grave.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Who?
Faint.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
You know - it <u>is</u>?
We'll have to look for them later.
Wonderful!
What about time...?
What direction does the system indicate?
Huh?
Take a look.
Thirty-four seconds!
What?
- for horrors like yourself?
Your friend was to remain where he was!
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
How soon?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Yeah.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Yeah?
You played for the Sox?
In the chest.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Lawford?
Break stuff?
What are you talking about?
It's not that.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Yes.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yes.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Nothing.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
I'm fine, fine.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Where's Jill?
Yeah.
Hi honey.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
What way?
It's nice.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
When did she die?
How's that?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
His office. You mean my old office.
Love! I'm made of love!
Crawl!
Twombley.
Who?
What happened?
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Money.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Not particularly.
Yeah.
That's what you think.
For what?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
I'm sure he's busy.
I'm sorry, honey.
Your father never means to be so...
Yes dear?
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Daddy...
Been better, Dad... You?
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Lemme take a look.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
This doesn't make sense.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Yes, Mr. President.
Because it is my duty.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
That was war.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
Please... don't start with me.
But...
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Yes I did...
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Not now, Elaine!
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
That was very well put, Ted.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Maybe.
Negative.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
What should I say?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
I can't tell.
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
Ted!
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Uh-huh.
Hello.
Yes, Captain?
What is it?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
I will, but Jim won't.
Of course.
The cockpit? What is it?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Yes.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Nothing.
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Did you learn anything?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Your mother mates out of season.
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
Why?
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
You must leave me alone on this.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Ss-ai!
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
... It's Harcourt.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Sure.  Just a minute.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
See you soon.
Well, thanks, I --
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Bullshit!
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
...We're coming in.
Alive?
Sure, Hicks.
About seventeen days.
Stand back.
We ain't going anywhere.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
Yeah.  What?
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
And hope to die?
You're really something, ace.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
You mean dead.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Right here, baby.  Right here.
That's right.
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
In a harem.
Perhaps.
You might be disappointed.
Don't bother.
I'm so relieved.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
I want to go!
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Tell them to go!
I love you! I love you!
Oh, damn!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
You'd think I was mad.
Why?
He's terribly busy, sir.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
What?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
He needs me, ma'am.
He asked me to stay.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
He's doing his best.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Adorable!
Hey!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Well. There it is.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Really?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
What is it?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Bene.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Animals?
German!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Well, we can.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
But this is absurd!
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
What exactly are you working on?
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
This is only a vaudeville.
The man. He's here.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Oh, yes.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
You go fast!
Just let me tell you how it begins.
On the contrary.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Mozart -
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Did you try?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Yes.
Incredible.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Well done, Sire!
What do you mean - now?
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Who is she?
Yes, I am looking after him.
Yes, Doctor.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Is David acting strangely?
No, a cab will be faster.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Now I'm embarrassed.
Very nice.
Yes?
I was awake and he was in my room.
A doper werewolf.
I'm freezing.
Jack is dead!
No.
No.
No.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
No, but we're about to.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
Oh, come on, tell us.
I was having a nightmare.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
So they said.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
You ask them.
Come on, I'm freezing.
Yeah?
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Plan?
Do you think it's a dog?
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Hi, David.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
He's on the telephone.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Yeah?
Aw, nerts!
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
What about?
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
Good for you. Come on.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
John, how's your wife this morning?
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Where is he now?
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes, thank you.
I haven't any.
Yes, sir.
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
If he can do it, yes.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
Are you sure?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Huh?
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
I don't know.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Never a good thing.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
You stay out of this, Bob.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Tomorrow.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
What is wrong with you?
She was European!
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
It was exciting.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
That's it.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Missed you too, cousin.
You ride like a Comanche.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
I'm thinking...
Which one, right or left?
Sadie was not a man!
Strategically.
They gonna rush us?
The District Marshall
You're right, sir.
I'd appreciate that.
What is it?
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Mm-hmm.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
You're doing just fine.
Bob's upset.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Oh yeah.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Yeah, Jimmy?
So what was he?
Yeah Jimmy?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Shush.
You didn't want to farm?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Thanks.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Right here in church?
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
I just though you were awful cute.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Yes sir.
How much did they get from the safe?
What is going on here, man?
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
In English, Pinkerton.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Nice?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Take it off.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
I never knew you smoked.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
I have to return some videotapes.
Nice.
I know her. I knew her.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
No, you...didn't?
Uh huh.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
What?
Like what?
Ask me a question.
Leaving what?
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Oh really? That's great.
See you then.
Negative. Cancel it.
Yes, sir.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
No, not really.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
What do you think I do?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
That's...that's too bad.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Does he do this all the time?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
No, I guess it's okay.
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
We were both seven in 1969.
What?
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
No.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Don.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
That's not the information I've received.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Where was Marcus?
I'm hungry.
Another Martini, Paul?
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
"Make" him?
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Teddy was killed last night.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Just shut up?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Great.
No.
He wasn't acting?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Yes sir.
Oh hi.
Definitely.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.

Hmm?
Certainly not at my happy home.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --

Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?

My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes?
Be careful.
Yes Basil?
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
Why?
Let me see.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
You know who.
Not now, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Behave!
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
That's not mine.
Where did you learn to shoot?
What are you saying, son?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Yes.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Yeah. What?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Blow me.
Show me.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Great.
He's asleep.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
You don't say. How real does it feel?
No need. I'll call again.
... bottle ...
... preserve...
... love...
So I'm still ...
I have an appointment.
Rules are made to be broken.
Then who wins?
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Ropes?
He tried to warn us ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
I'm already married ...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
I'll never marry you.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Yes indeed. I need protection.
June, July ... August?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
Any ideas?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
No trouble.
Always.  Except ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Winning isn't everything.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
You don't trust me?
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Have a look at this.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Peter's brother?  But --
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Getting to what?
... and now?
I shall need a small plane.
Global warming?
We want Mrs. Peel.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Anyone particular in mind?
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Where?
Both, actually.
This way ...
Did I? My mistake.
Ugh ...
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What is this person's story here?
Oh, come on, just a little.
She's mine!
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Are you going to have women at your party?
I can't sleep.
About what?
C'mere.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Yes...
Ilene, Rick promised...
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Great, Mom.
You know your father enjoys his company.
What are you talking about, asshole?
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
What are you...
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
What's going on?
Yes.
You're a pimp?
Milt?
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Can't I just maim it a little?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The phone made me do it!
Of course.
My gift to you.
The best table in the house.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Who's your friend?
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
I'm saved. Let's party!
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
He's alive.
Just come down, John. Just --
Who asked you?
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Thanks for the insight.
Just leave me alone, okay?
Saw what?
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
Jennifer.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Got anything to drink in there?
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Just take it.
That's a dumb thing to say.
It's a small town.
Then who --
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Glass?
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
What?
But he killed these guys.
What reason?
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Yeah? Airtight?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
How ya feeling?
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Yeah.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Backdraft.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
And DIE!
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Here we go...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
-- You remember.
You treated me like shit.
He's out.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
And the world -- the whole world.
"Don?"
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Nah...
Who?
You mean you could use it.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
All right, cop. I want my money.
How about 7 1/2?
What case?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
She's also moorish.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Look at my lips.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
We might need some mo' money behind this.
EUREKA!!
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Why?
Mantan!!
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I've never been given a fair shot.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
It's been a long time.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Do you know how you will use him?
This is Cheeba.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
What do you want me to say?
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
You sound like the media.
It looks delicious.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Not at all?
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
She hates dem.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
I thought you got rid of...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
...too early...
...like grits and butter...
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Y'know what?
And what?
Say what, Manray?
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
I never was more in earnest.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
How do you do, sir?
And so I am.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
I have faced that problem before.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Agreed.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Yes, papa.
Is he all right, papa?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
And he doesn't care about me?
Tender Hegenheim.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
I'm -- I'm sorry...
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
We found him like this...
They're dead, aren't they?
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
I'm serious --
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
Epilepsy.
The creek bed --
Would you have believed me?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
You hated West more than any of us.
Oh, come on --
Just look. Little pocket.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
I didn't kill him --
No. I said Dunbar.
Maybe he...
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
What the hell are you talking about --
Does Osborne agree?
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
That's preposterous --
You're crazy --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Why?
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
What point?
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Watch me.
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
What?
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Let's go talk to Bill...
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Get in.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Tough.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
So you took off your shirt?
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
He whispered it in my ear.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Wrong answer --
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Who is she? Where does she live?
There's only one I want.
Thank you.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
It truly is.
No one's ever left.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
Please?
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Really?
I can.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Oh, so you know.
I think someone hasn't.
The river?
Go out with me.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Really.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
That's because most of it never happened.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
There's over eighty thousand here.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Leave him!
No I haven't.
Uh... Yes.
I'm asking what you're here for.
Good. 
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
You're asking for my documents?
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
No. It is too judgmental.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
No. It's not that.
You can stay tonight.
Good night.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
No I don't.
It's none of your business.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Sometimes neither.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You don't understand you either.
Please, there's no... Oh.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Well what have you got?
No.
I'm trying to quit.
Whatever.
Please. Why not?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Maybe you will find out.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
At church?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
Now wait...
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
And you gonna live it with him?
LAZ, I said let...!
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
What?
No ma'am.
Whose doin' is that?
Itches.
Uh-uh.
Sure.
Anything.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
I tried.
Nothin'.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Huh?
This Rae... you get with her?
Why you say that?
Now, hold up.
Naw!
Like I told you.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
I didn't start this, R.L.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
The hell you call me?
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Get rid of it.
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
The Wolf?
Saving your life.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
What does Charlie mean?
Connie...
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
Why weren't you at the platform?
I can see that.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Sure.
Ichiro --
Shut-up.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Let's go.  Him first.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
No.
I don't know.
Luck.
Why's that?
Where's Ich?
I need someone to translate for me.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
You could fake it.
You met her.
I'm taking you back.
Save it, I already took the tour.
What?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
Not to be trapped.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Well, actually
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Dr. Tyrell?
Hello, glad to meet you.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
You didn't like her!?
She's not with you?
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
I think we're through for the night.
Do you have something against science?
And what in your estimation works?
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
It's okay.  Forget it.
Prosit.
I don't know.
Four years.
No.  I got a problem.
Nope.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
What's suck night?
I think you need more help than you've got.
Me and my dad.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
I never felt better.
What's a long time?
What?
Yes.
Thirteen.
Don't move.
A tortoise.  What's that?
I never seen a turtle.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
You like it?
Really?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Young man, stop right there!
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Yes, I'm right?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
You don't?
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Heck, no!  What?!
Perry?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
I know a short-cut.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
How long would you need me?
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
What?
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Of course.
Yes, ma'am!
Is this your house?
What?!
Yes!
So, what are you seeing?
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Okay!
Well...yeah. Okay.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Is that what you call it?
Yes, Eve?
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
My mother's like that.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh, I think they have.
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Russia.
Juneau.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I just don't want to.
I LOVE THIS!!
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
Goodbye.
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
How do you do, ma'am.
Good!
Hi.
Yes, ma'am.
Are you in trouble, son?!
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Yes.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
What about relatives?
Yeah.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Yes, dear!
To go up.
All our friends...
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Coming!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Just open the door.
Mutants?!
I don't believe it!
We do?
Well, I am the head of this household--
Yes, dear, I know.
I knew you'd like him.
Oh, yes.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
What's that supposed to mean?
Eve?!
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
To bed.
Fallout shelter.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
What?!
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Yes.
It must be great.
Okay.
Yes.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Never before this.
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Do you know?
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Same here.
No.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Don? Are you in with them?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Please, please stay.
Hello.
Frank is coming?
Whatiya mean?
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Kiss me.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I did. Are you?
I want you to stay with me.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
You want to see him too, right?
Then, shut up!
Those are my breasts.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Here's to Ben.
Yes.
Do you want the car?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Yeah, I know.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
I'll get a coat for her.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Hey Jeff.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I'm here, aren't I?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah.
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Two.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Yes.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, Sandy.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Where's your gun?
Let's do him right here.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
BLAME...
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We... met them last night.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Ass!
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
He's a good man.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Uh... two shooters!
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
How do you figure?
Rocco!
Pee...Per...Man.
The fat man.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
What about one guy with two guns?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
What?
Twist of lemon!
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Who were the victims?
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Just called ta torture us did ya?
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
This is some crazy shit, man!
You believe?
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
You know them personally?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
God have mercy on my soul.
Just go!
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
No. This is he.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Would they do that?
What do you think the cops have?
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Yeah.
Just turn right here.
Nothing. Go ahead.
Where's the other stocker?
Like he meant it.
I don't want to use it.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
On your marks...  Get set go.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
No kidding.
This morning.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Can you hand me those french fries.
What?
I don't think we can do that.
Shh.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
That's not correct.
She needed it.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Right now.
Get out of the way.
I don't think you will.
He was all right.
Hang on a second.
Careful. Check his pulse.
I'll get him.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
Oh, I'd say about --
Behind Bob's house.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
How?
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
It feels good.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Let them fight.
What was that?
There's a million places to hide around here.
Move.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
True.
I don't know about that.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
Yes. I did.
Good question.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Maybe she turned.
Let's just go.
God DAMMIT.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
No. I was calm.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
I don't want to talk about it.
There were more than that.
Come on, Dignan.
Anthony. Bad news.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
Look. We want you on the job.
I think so.
What's that?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
He's damn good.
Fight. You know.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
It's locked.
There was a mistake.
Will it track back to us?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
No good options left?
And?
Okay.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
Yes...
Then what?
You're a liar.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Felt a little light.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
Conklin up front.
I worry when you get like this.
The Telegraph office.
He was at the campground yesterday.
What?
-- where? -
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Yes.
Who's going? Us?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
You mean, did I want a date?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
And why is that?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We must sue for peace.
So let the council swear publicly.
He has already agreed to come.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
Scotland. He intends --
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
You fancy him.
Fourteen? --
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
I rest.
No. One of us is enough.
Let her speak.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Thank you for inviting.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
What is it?
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
And the bad news?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
How soon?...
Um... can dad come this time?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
No, protecting her.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
What do you want to know, Evan?
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
You'll see.
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Like how?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Know what?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Been there, done that.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Evan Treborn.
Deal. Now read me something.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
I come from a big family.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Oh my God oh my God...
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Suppose we do.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
Practically no one.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
And the carrying charges?
I'll tell him when he comes in.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Yes, something.
Good day.
You needn't be concerned about me.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
What are they?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
No.
I will.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
And I was wondering.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Won't you join us?
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Goodnight.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Of course, I'll be careful.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
What for?
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Very well.
Yes.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
I expected no less, Captain.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
A leader, like Laszlo?
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
What, again?
His escape.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Huh?
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I never make plans that far ahead.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Uh, my watch stopped.
Just a little something of my own.
Yes, boss.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
As much as anybody.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
I had it on the island with me.
I thought I did.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
For when I travel?
You can't go now.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Is that Jango?
My epitaph.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
And how was your Christmas?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Let's eat.
Mom, meet Jango.
That new roof, that's your doing.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
What about the sender?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
But I might not have.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
I braided them.
Believe me I know.
What?
Deep, real deep.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
Life is waiting.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
You cook very well!
Better than I can!
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Good night, Daddy.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Really?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
"King Kong". It's really good.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
Sure. Thanks.
Hi...
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
She looks after other people's children.
No. She was an immigrant.
I don't remember.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
Migrants?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Right?
Obviously.
In other words, scurvy.
Nobody's named this one yet.
I'm happy I amuse you.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
When will he be home, Major?
It look nicer then home!
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
The standard ten.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
And these cops? What do they get?
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
So what? We hide, right?
We're going to give him the money back?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
Jake, I mean, come on --
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Well, this is just fucking great...
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
You sure?
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
No. Just confidence.
I think two million.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
No thanks. I'm good.
I think I just broke my hand.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Help me.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
You get an equal cut.
What?
Intuition.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Glenn talked you out of it.
You sure we're clear?
What?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
And we got rid of the red head.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
I can handle it.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Jack Manfred.
Maybe another time.
All men are cheats.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Sorry.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
I'm working on that soccer story.
Habib?
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I don't know.
Tension. It'll go.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
What about a drink on the way home?
Marion. It's a book.
It's the truth.
Never. Why do you ask?
I hate public transport.
Found a job?
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
In the casino.
Absolutely not.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Who's they?
No thank you.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Who...
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
Some other time.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Rough life, Jack.
I put them on together.
I was at Beadles.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
We do. 
What happens if I want to sneeze?
Five.
Five.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
All right, Mr Reynolds.
I can see.
Eventual supernova.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Oh, God...
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
All right, then...
Check at six minutes.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Thanks.
No.
Hello, bomb.
Bomb?
Right!
Hmmm...
Mafhkin oble groop...
I'll check it.
Doolittle...
What?
I hereby name this star Fred.
Out where?
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Yeah?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
What was that, Doolittle?
Sorry.
Bruno's girlfriend.
How I make my living, what's your point?
Yeah?
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
That's not why we're here.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
What the hell are you doing?
She was there...
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
Police drone.
No time.
Don't look down.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
I don't get involved with guns.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Whoever that is.
Logan Cale.
Lauren's not my wife.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Something.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
A girl.
Your help.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Somebody's got to.
Can't help you.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Here's your money.
How's this about me?
What guys do.  'Nother order.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
But I'll take a rain check...
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
I'm the victim here.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Easy Sketchy.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
I was on call. 
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
He's sick.
Gin.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Thanks.
Yeah?
Believe it.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Damn straight we are.
Curly.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Nah. Couldn't be.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Go ahead, Jam.
NOW!
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
What?
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
The KISS Army!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, you did!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
GOOD MORNING!
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Sure.
You mean soap?
Wonder where we'll be then.
Why is that?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
It's safe here.
Why? Is this about the book?
Who's Frank?
Yeah...
When did you stop taking your medication?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Why should we care?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yes.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
God exists because you're horny.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Where is he, Donald?
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
I was just being honest.
Her name is Gretchen.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Beg pardon?
But now you can't go.
Loretta, never have kids.
Thank God for bunge cords.
Really?
Your parents'd kill you.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Yah?
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
I just did.
Bitch!
Yes, Leslie!
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
You could be quiet.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Gladys! Stop it!
Nothin' too showy!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Harold!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
The king can do to wrong! 
"My dear"...
"My dear President"...
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I don't want him.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
She did.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
The king can do no wrong!
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
I've always thought that myself.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
And here are my mother and father.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
Shut up!
Everything will be seen to.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
I don't understand.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I am very pleased to meet you.
Three quarters of an hour.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
You've never been?
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
y-y-yes--
You're English.
Yes.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Good morning.
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
...I learned a long time ago.
Yyyess.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Say "Merrick".
Say "Mmmerrick."
Righteousness...
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
Of course! What did you think?
Thank you very much.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
No, he's very upset about something.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
A dressing bag.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Who, Father?
There IS no one.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
It was different...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
We never went to bed together.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
Five this week; how many the week before?
But, Erik...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Not quite...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
I'm sure it's lovely.
You're just saying that.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Yes?
You DON'T like it, do you?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
I didn't mean to!
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
What a stupid idea.
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Well... no...
But...
No.
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
I met this girl...
That's my boy!
You may need a real Berserk.
Look out!
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
Who gets killed?
Keitel Blacksmith?
How about making friends?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
Over the Edge of the World.
Please.
The Dragon...
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
No, it is NOT.
Bastard.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
What are you talking about?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
I... I...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Help!
Help!
So did your father...
I must only let the red rage...
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Say hi to Naomi.
I told you that later.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
I don't know what that means.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Yeah?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
I like to read.
Sort of, um...
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Yeah.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
Would you get me another, Joely?
No.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I don't know.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Yeah.
Naomi, I guess.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Female.
What are you doing?
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I love you.
What if?
I don't know.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Oddly enough, I do.
I guess so.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
It's too late.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
It's not somebody else.
Hi.
It's a good one all right.
Where?
How did I look?
Nothing.
Yes?
Welcome, Howard.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Just wanted to let you know.
You can if you want.
Jesus, Patrick!
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
I know who you are.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Easy come, easy go.
I'm staying with the Countess.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I have to go, Julian.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
I don't know anything about it.
Justin?
Don't start with me, Cooper.
What about the accumulator...?
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Hurry.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
No.
A power drain --
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
How do you know all this?
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
Skipper...
...you okay?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Do it.
Justin.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Negative.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
It's complicated...
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
What do you want me to say?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
What makes you think I'll miss?
Better if I just show you.
NOOO!
What is that?
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Something like that, yeah.
Starck...
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
Come again, Skipper?
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Let's go.
Come around to three-three-four...
Radiation interference?
Keep your eyes open.
We're all here.
But you can breathe it.
How much oh-two do we have?
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
I did.
Can you shut it down?
Keep him talking.
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Ship's log.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
And you can? Power it up?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Five times.
Victor's better at these things.
Should?
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Go back to the drawing board.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Ben, are you there?
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Right, whatever, have fun.
I think that thing is Ben.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Blockhead started it!
And if he's not...?
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
It's been changed.
Passion.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
I gave him twenty.
Why didn't you say something?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Hilarious.
Reed, we're running out of time.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Raising the shields.
Just find him.
Susan. What are you doing?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Of course.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Later.
Manager!!
Sis.
They're not home yet.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Why?
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
I didn't say that.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
No.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Ugh.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
You first.
Let's continue.
What? Are you all right?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
We've got to get an abortion?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
All right. Pay attention.
Damone. It's Mark.
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Okay. See ya.
Really.
No Damone. I don't understand.
Whatever you say, Rat.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
How often do you go?
They're fuckin' with us.
Just be glad you're all right.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Do you think that guy's cute?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Believe it.
I know.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
What variables?
It was nice.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Not since November.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
What do you think it is?
That little prick.
That little prick.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
What do you want?
He's not coming.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Yeah, like maybe never.
Yes.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
I don't know. I guess so.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
The point sounds fine.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
What about those other guys you live with?
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Oh yeah.
Two more Cokes.
Do you want to come inside?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Do you really have to go?
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Two Cokes.
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
This is my granddaughter...
What?
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
My heart!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
GO?
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
How about a check?
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Me?
It's gone too far.
Where'd you get this?
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Where is everyone?
Her fella.
Hey!
What!? I'm not going down there again!
Just an observation.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Anyone else?
What?
Well...
But --
What?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Clear!
What?
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
HELLLPPP!
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
We all have to be strong, right?
Oh...
I'd love to.
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Who's this?
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
You see: We've got to change that name.
I'd like nothing better.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
Who is she?
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Who?
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
Really?
See you next weekend, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
Is Kaminski a Communist?
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
Be careful, Francie.
Always. Always.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Why, you... you little bastard!
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
...So you think I should go.
Eight stories.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Think I'll have a glass.
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
That's right.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
I'm not sure.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Who're you?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
'Golden Boy.'
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
What's wrong?
Yes, Mama.
I'm going out!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
But what -- 
Oh bullshit.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Yeah?
Better that way... for me.
Worse.
I don't know.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
Her body pleases me.
It's been months. It's not like him.
So have I
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Aren't you?
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
The world is a dizzying place.
And you?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I wish to be your husband.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Why the change? What about your work?
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Oh God.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
No. They don't.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
I finished the boats.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Un-hunh.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Not if they're where I think they are.
I'll go take a look.
They're off now.
Somebody'll see.
For sure.
A short somewhere.
Is it stuck?
I don't believe you...
That was the telephone.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Umhummmmph.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Sure.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Have you ever been there before?
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
I said new, this is an '90.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
Yes, she is.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
To yours.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
I wasn't scratching!
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
Really?
They broke when you fell.
That's what you look like.
Where are you?
Yeah, it's mine.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
Thank you, ensign.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Your prerogative, Senator.
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Didn't take long.
Pardon?
No, sir.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
Sir?  What did he say?
Motherachrist...
I'll act surprised.
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
I was one member of the investigating commission.
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Yes, dear.
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
What changed?
I'm sure it is.
No, ma'am.
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Get it up!
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
I don't know...
Mighta been civilian.
Smoke it!
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
15, sir.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
O'Neil, Jordan.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Women.
Great. See ya then.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Oh yes he will.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
How do you know?
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
What do I get?
Five bucks.
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
It's your choice.
What?
We? I don't think so.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
You're fast.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
We've met before.
Oh.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Why are you telling this to me?
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
I'm... I'm shot.
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
I played Richard III...
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
The guy is terminally selfish!
You could order something in.
What?
No I didn't.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
It's ... incredible.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
Not a clue. You?
You smiled at me.
Jason..
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
It helps.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Turn on the translation circuit.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Because it was on the show!
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
You have ten seconds.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Home.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
It's as far as it goes!
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
How about the pig-lizard?
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Get oacK on their tail.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
You seem pleased by the prospect.
And a French alliance?
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
The army can survive without me.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
I?  You all know my history.
That can't be.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
No one knows...
To hell with Arnold...
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
I'm not sure.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
I understand, George.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
I rode here, on my horse.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
I'm very aware of that.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Martha!  For God's sake!
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
It is; we need you George.
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Calm down, Bear...
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
Harry, let me answer that.
That's right, me.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Who?
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
I don't believe this.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
In the can. That the money?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
It's not the kind of thing you do.
That's correct. Look at me.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I don't like waiting.
I'm a producer.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Leo spanked a waitress?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
You just did.
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
Not really.
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
Let's see how we get along.
Never say anything unless you have to.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
Buddy?
I'm up twelve grand today.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
Sit down, Leo.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
What if it was?
What're you doing here?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Don't go out of your way.
Right. See how your story ends.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
And you think the movie business is any different?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
What happened?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I'm going into the movie business.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Come on in.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Shylock?
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Sixty pounds.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
What?
Roger?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Bring it on, dude.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Seen a lota movies.
What is it?
Like I always say --
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
What is it?
Don't lie to me!
There's a charming thought.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Probably didn't have time.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
You're a pal.
Lights?
Nope.
The guy. He just came this way.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
If it was a ship she hit.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Epps, over.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
Go.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
You don't remember?
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Shut up.
A what?
Better late than never.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
How should I know?
YES.
What is it now?
Nothing.
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Are you going to yell at me?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
But I can't --
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
You can count on me, sir!
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Can I come in?
I guess.
Then why do you hate me so much?
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Good.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
What a little hosebag.
Why do I always have to do it?
I'm going to tell him you said that.
I can't believe it!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Gross!
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Somewhere downtown.
What, is she black now?
What are you talking about?
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
Everybody's too stupid!
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
Where did you get that?
Where?
He does that every single day.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
Go ahead...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
You're insane.
What thing?
So should I come over?
What are you talking about? Who?
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
It's fine.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Maybe an orange juice.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Well, we won't keep you.
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
Yes.
Hey, where are you going?
Well why do I care about that?
God, fuck you!
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Yeah, well...
Jesus!
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Shh!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
Hooray for me.
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Really?
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
Can you at least let me in?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
She's not at home?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
But overall, you're pleased?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
We have hunted since childhood.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
I assure you we came close many times-
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
So that's what a lion looks like. 
John, it will not be easy.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
What happened to them?
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Does he ever mention me?
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
We definitely had a moment or two.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Now you're talking.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
What are you doing up here?
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Okay.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
My pleasure.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Who are they?
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
What?  Yeah.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
And decent.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Uuuuuuugh!!
Ummm -- figure eight?
Eight o'clock?
Hi, Louis.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I told you, I ...
Are you all right?
That's it.  Get out.
Out!
Then leave.
You heard it?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
I want you inside me.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Print is dead.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
I don't believe in luck.
Here are tonight's calls.
The EPA?  What's he want?
You could say that.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
See!  They are using drugs.
Yes.  I don't like this.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
I'm always serious.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
She said he was "the Destructor."
God, it's ugly!
Neutronize.  System shut.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Right.  We'll believe anything.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
Yes?  Go on!
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
You flatter me, Caesar.
We have to stop the Germans now!
They won't break this one.
Until your confirmation date.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Yes, Caesar.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
You're hearing about somebody else.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
Yours will do!
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
They fear me.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Well, we can try...
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Greeks?
They're studying with Cynics.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
No!
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
I killed too many barbarians.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
I want nothing to do with the arena.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No.
Yes, I do.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Yes.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Oh my God --
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Here he comes.
What do you think?
All right then! Yes!
Elaine -- I love you.
What?
You've got to tell me what she said.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
I don't know.
I'll think about it.
Carl who?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
No.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
Yes.
Will you bring it in to me?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
It's in the main ballroom.
A single. Just for myself, please.
What?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
When is he coming back?
Well I don't know.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Would you like me to seduce you?
Let me out!
I've got to go.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Very well. Thank you.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
What?
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
That's fine.
I'll be up in five minutes.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Wait a minute!
Well?
Neither.
No.
What one.
There's no risk?
What?
We don't.
About five years.
Is it?
No.
Art.
Kind of.
How do you think.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
What?
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
I was just kidding around.
But why shouldn't I?
Yes.
I wouldn't know.
If that's how you feel --
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
What?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Not if you don't want to.
No.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
That has nothing to do with it --
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
Oh no.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
That's quite a statement.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
No --
With the pearls?
Not with strangers.
Dictation.  You know...
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Where downstairs?
Of course.
All right. We'll dance.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
I feel sorry for him.
Yes --
For tonight. 
What do you want here?
Why do you hide in my room?
Because you love me -- you love me?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Yes -- I do understand.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
I want to be alone.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Shall I see you again?
When are you leaving Berlin?
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
I did not ask your advice.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Oh -- what -- what -- 
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Later?
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
Movies?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
What?
Definitely off.
Well -- you want me?
Well?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
We did not approach you.
What a session this has been.
He likes to play the great man.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Such nonsense.
Again?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
You are late. Hurry.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Have I kept you waiting?
No news yet?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
My son was in the hospital --
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
We're not really interested, Henry.
Can't move.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
You know who I work for.
I know.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
What is?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
I'll get you a check.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Hello.
Lead on.
So I heard.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
Fair enough.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
No. And you have to be.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
As though you do what I say.
And Myra's stuff?
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
Not very good!
Uh-huh.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
In your other hand.
Mm?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
All? It ain't bad.
No, baby. Come to Mama.
Every day in every way.
You already went back to work.
I thought these people were broke.
What happened to Cole?
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
What?
Bullshit!
I'm happy the way I am.
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Happy to see you looking so good.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Girl scouts.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Doesn't look good.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Forget it.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
No.
I was trying to protect you from this...
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
I came to see you.
Then you come out here.
What?
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Yeah.
You're unbelievable.
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
But I've seen him!
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
I'll meet you over there.
It was you.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
No one.
No!!!
You know what gets me?
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Go home!
Go home.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
You know me, boy.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
When?
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno.
In what way, pray tell?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
How are you, honeybunch?
You've come to the right man.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
You're hollow, like a woman.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Out!
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Everybody says he was so brave.
He insults him all the time.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Penelope!
Penelope!
The smallest thing I've got.
Make it fast.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
What's this?
No.
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
Heaven.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought a doctor might help.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Have some.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
Say hello to your mother.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Ram it up your ass!
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Yes.
Sneaking in the back door.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
I plan to live one hundred years!
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
No.
Don't!
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Out!
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Ooops.
And her fiancé!
I've literally got to run!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
Would you say that again?
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
What for?
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
You haven't heard me yet.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
I've enjoyed being man.
Get up.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
She did?
There was so much going on.
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Yes.
Premature ejaculation.
Don't worry about it.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
What a relief!
Father's friend.
That man is your father.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
Doing what?
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
You figure!
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
Marry me instead.
You're saying no.
Take plenty of cigars.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
We've got to rescue him.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
What girls you got here?
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Yeah.
Um-hm. Live sound.
Do you know where she lives?
Three hundred?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
Ulcers.
She's dead.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Not very.
Tijuana.
He deals in pain.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
On your own land?
What makes you so sure?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
...What do you have to offer?
Who's paying you?
Yeah.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
I don't know.
Do you think she's safe?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
That's not true, Mr...?
No.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Who?
They're all about the same. You want something?
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
What do you think of that? Or this?
Oh.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
To anybody.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
You working in San Diego now?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Oh, I don't have one.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Hello.
None of that, lady.
Is this your shovel?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
It's very interesting.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Promise?
Yes. Very much.
That's really great.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Over there by the courthouse.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
What is that he's working on?
It is kind of rough.
Look, the ice is melting.
No more revolts.
But I don't play anything.
Superb.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
What was that?
I like you, Maude.
It's so blue.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
To whom?
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
No. My uncle.
Like a tea ceremony?
A rough estimate.
Ah, yes.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
War is not all black.
ZAT!
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
Julia.
Yes!
It certainly is.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Is he serious??
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
See? I don't like that --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
What is it?
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
No. It was red. Bright red.
Who wards off demons.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Noooo! Noooo!!!
My job.
No. I never was.
Hostage negotiations.
Alone?
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Cocky.
Coffee's warming me up.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
I have to speak to my father.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
I don't remember.
Kirsty?
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
I don't want to see the dress.
Who?
A box?
Let me see.
Hell...
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Hi. I got soaked.
Which is where?
I was here this afternoon.
The best part of ten years.
Shit.
Can I get you anything?
Kirsty.
We don't need a bed, do we?
I prefer the floor.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Daddy?
YOU'D like my room.
You will keep in touch.
Is Julia here?
Surprise.
I love you, honey.
Finished?
Yes!
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
Are you alright ?
'Bye.
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
I beg your pardon?
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Laura.  Her dad died.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
What?
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
I have a television.
Nobody.
He's not worth it!
Oh, hi.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Pardon me?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Hey Rob.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
I'll tape it for you.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
I understand, Dick.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Think about it, Rob.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
I think you know that.
What, what?
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Nevermind.
Just ask it!
You really think it would make a difference either way?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
I don't have your number.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Well, think about it.
C'mon.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You're tougher.
I'm alright.
No use.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
I'm going to talk to you.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Good.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
I'm sure it isn't.
Whiskey.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Yeah.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
I'm Vince.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
It's in good condition.
Thanks.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
I don't follow you.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
People like that rarely leave business cards.
That bothers you?
Have you gone to the police?
Are you?
You're a fool.
Not all of them.
You won't.
He knows about you.
No!
The inheritance.
You have lived forever.
Spare me the details.
What are you getting at, Moran?
What's all of this got to do with me?
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Your name is Conor?
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
Why are you here?
It is less.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
No!
This is madness!
This can't be.
Go to hell.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
But why be so concerned about me?
That is not me.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
What would you like?
Like you.
Do you have cause to bothering us?
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
Finish yours?
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
We need more time.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
You'd think he'd had practice.
He knows I'm here.  How?
Kahn?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
He always did.
I've had a few more concerns.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Are you here?
And if I refuse?
That's none of your business.
Your murder weapon?
A mystery.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
His only kid.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Open this door!
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
No. Roy. Roy V.
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Hello, Bruce...
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Where are we going?
No -- she didn't.
No. My mother.
How?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
You haven't seen anything yet.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You'll ask me to what?
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Out of the mouths of babes.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
I notice you still remember it.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Just what I said. That's what I --
Listen, Walter --
You -- you --
What's the matter?
Get away, Svengali.
Please! Will you just --
I'm not working for any other paper!
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Where'd you meet this man?
What's his line?
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
You're not afraid, are you?
Now you got me.
Thank you.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Where's some paper?
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
All right, Walter.
What tickets?
Is he coming back here?
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Don't tell me you were worried!
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
You -- you!!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I'm busy, Duffy.
What?
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
I think it is.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
All right -- all right!
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
What have you got, Hildy?
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
I'll have it in a minute.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
So long, Hildy.
Little rum in yours, too?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
What?
Yeah. But I --
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Fred!
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
I never saw him before!
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
I thought so, too.
No -- what?
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
That man there!
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Isn't that her picture?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
You mean here in the city?
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
A very fine-looking women.
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
We want to see you.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
But Grandpa, you said...
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Who told you that?
Yes.
Ask her yourself.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
Well, for the baby, really.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Air-raid?
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
Bugger the Buffs.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Jam.
That's it.
Fair enough.  The river.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
We did the decent thing.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Father, that's enough now
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Huh... what cone?
Cool.
No, I told you...
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Where's that?
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
OK.
A dead one.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Great story Goober, how much?
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Way out here?
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Yeah, showtime for what?
Man, it's already ten thirty.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Where ya headed?
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
I hear ya.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Tickets for what?
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Sleeping.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Yep, I suppose it is.
What do they call you, sweety?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Firefly.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
You said it, not me.
Enough with the stupid voices.
Sorry.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What! God damn, how many?
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Call Wydell.
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I always favored the Hulk.
Aw, fuck.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Oui, doctor, oui.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Of course not.
That would be good.
Not in front of the boy.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That's Lila?
Very well.
But I like being human now.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
One night stand?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
With pleasure.
Shut up, you.
Where?
What's the larger experiment?
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
That's a great idea.
Terrific. Can't wait!
I don't think so.  Why?
Yes, darling.
A deer?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
All right.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Really?
Oh boy!
Thank you very much for that.
Shit.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Oook. Oook.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Lila?
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
No.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
That's right, Miss Packard.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
You ever played billiards before?
Thought you only drank milk.
Yeah? Why?
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
A thousand.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
To do what?
Why?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
I been thinking.
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
'Bout even.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
Want some free advice?
You well-heeled, partner?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
I don't want it.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
I feel tight -- but good.
Eddie...
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Now and then. Why, do you?
Would you like to come out tonight?
Okay?
Yeah. Sure.
Hi.
You're a pretty good player.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
What?
What bus?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Then why go to the bus station?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
No, not always.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I'm not.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
Haven't you opened it?
What's this supposed to mean?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
A loser?
Is he a winner?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Leave now.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
I'll be up later.
Well, what's the matter?
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
Yes.
We move.  Place to place.
My wife.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
Yes.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Virginia...?
You got that right.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Okay.
What did it look like?
Sure ... fine.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Good night.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Why, yes.  Why?
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
No.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
All their lines were busy.
Hide the car.
What?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
It's really nice of you to help us.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
David, don't...
He's a good man.
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
More than likely.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
That's the good news?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
I'm thinking.
Three years.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
Can't this thing go any faster?
They don't know this.
Dad...
She didn't take my name when we were married.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Just getting a feel for her.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Then God help us.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
ETA with target; four minutes.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
Yes, Sir.
Better than we thought.
And our troops here?
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
Butt-munch.
Butt-munch.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Jimmy, stay with me.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
You sure?
But, Mr. President...
Yes.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
You've got it!
All your life.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
Alexandretta. Now we know.
I'm going after Dad.
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
How dare he?!
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
That was our assessment as well.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Yes?
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Lower me down.
Are you sure?
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Good point.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
There were rats, Dad.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
My lucky charm.
What?
I'm out, Dad!
Booby traps?
What about Marcus?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Thanks.
Dad, we're well out of range.
Junior?! Dad...
After you, Junior.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Come on -- come on!
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
No.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
Yes, I understand.
Just a statue.
You don't like him do you?
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
You're betrayed Shiva. 
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
Their children?
First of all -- don't panic!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
What does the writing say?
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
Maybe he likes older women.
You're talking to an authority in that area.
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Don't catch cold.
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
What above the curves?!
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
You're not gonna believe this...
I'm...inside you.
Don't do that.
Me.
Al.
Yes.
What is your name?
No.
Kill myself.
Yeah.
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Why not?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Too late...They want you.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
Why?
I am. You are.
Find You?
We have to get out of here.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Go out, take your first left.
With Authority!
What am I supposed to do?
Use my credit cards.
Little late for that.
The sand.
Eat it.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
I made it work.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
How do you know?
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
What am I supposed to do?
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
I told you, I have a feeling...
Don't worry!
Too late.
Never mind, just say it.
No. You can't trust her.
Come on.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
While he makes the run.
...Shit! It's just money.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
Keep thinking.
Now, you're too suspicious.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
It'll remind me of you.
Dieter?
I insist.
Let us get to the border!
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
What a nerve!
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
Then how did you know?
Surveilliance on them all.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
I have a new client.
Yes. Joe.
That name's familiar.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
What?
Oh.
Oh...that's okay.
Do what?
How do I look?
Thanks.
Here?
I feel fine.
I will?
What?
Oh yeah, thanks...
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
A little voice in my head.
Yessir...very good sir.
Blake?
Yes?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Yes, of course.
Me still. They left you alone?
It's not apparent.
That you're not crazy.
You talk to yourself.
Hires you for what?
There's not much to tell.
You did.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
How do you know you can trust me?
What is it?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
We figure out if it's in here.
Hong Kong.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
You coming along?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What?
Her?
Now what?
That's twenty feet high.
Thanks.
Whoever took it does.
Hi, Daddy.
What's that outside, Daddy?
In the backyard.
You got a deal. 
Monday.
What? Forget it.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Okay.
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Get me Wigand.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, I'm not...
Okay. 
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Thomas Sandefur...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Jeffrey...
No, you do not.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Yeah.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
Hardly new news.
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
What I've seen... I've liked.
Black, black...
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
No.
You believe that?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I don't think you really understand --
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
I'll call them, Lowell.
I heard.
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
What?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
I can't say that!
She's okay.
Well, what do you really think, though?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
That's why we hire scientists...
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
Is that... one person?
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
So, that's good, right?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
Isn't everything?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Marylin! Listen to me.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Have you tried the duck?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Huh?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Do you want to sleep on it?
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
May I come in?
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
That's blackmail.
You have to leave the house immediately!
That's true.
Hello Miles.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Jesus.
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
She did a Harriman.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
Hello Miles.
I guess.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I don't know. I can assume...
Well -- is that possible?
She always looked out for me.
Video.
What...?
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Muriel Rumsey.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Yes, sir?
Yeah.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
Do you love her?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
South America.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Stunt?
Nothing. 
On the road.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
He's marvelous!
I don't know.
Why? Do you know him? 
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Sock her!
Any others?
But the lady says—
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Why, you ungrateful brat!
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
What are you talking about?
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
The pleasure is all mine.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Next week "East Lynne."
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
I don't trust that chatterbox.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
Oh, Peter— 
I don't want it now.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
You're an expert, I suppose.
Oh, no!
Clever.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Amazing.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
A black eye. 
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
I love you.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter—
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Do you know?
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
What's that?
Yes?
Don't "Joe" me.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Okay, pete. 
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Yeah.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Yeah. Come on—come on!
Yeah—wouldn't it?
Huh?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
No.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Where you going, boss?
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Yeah.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
What was so appealing about Houston?
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
What?
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Huh?
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
Well... yeah.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
Take a look across the street.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
His name?
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
And Oswald?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
That sounds fun.
Six.
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
Three years.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
I need a favor.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Course you didn't.
In his inside coat pocket.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
What time do you have to be there?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
Take your time.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Can you do it or not?
Okay.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
It's kind of a sports bar
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
I am, as a matter of fact.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
He's got that kinda money?
Cash poor?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Sure.
Are you?
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
I'm old enough to be her father.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
When did you decide?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Do you think they bought it?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
It's not that simple.
Set him up.
We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
Less ten percent.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
You'll get over that.
Spain.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
I'm just tired in general.
I beg your pardon?
Do you live together?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
Can I smoke?
If I'm working, I can help you.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
You talk to him?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
I never have. It's not my money.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
Gimme one anyway.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Kinda.
Keep it between us girls?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Thanks.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
They asked.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Baby, I didn't --
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Man, I don't like that part.
She don't know shit about the money.
Designer clothes.
Where you gonna be during all this?
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Two months shy of four years.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
It's a diet thing?
The roller disco one.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
You been to Japan?
Yeah.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Uh-huh?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Yeah, down the end.
Okay, Lou-is.
What's your cost?
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Which one is for the car?
Okay.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
Yep.
Did you get it?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
I shot her.
You know how she is.
Uh-huh.
Pretty sure.
What?
Maybe the Feds got it.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Tell me.
You gonna tell me who it was?
How am I supposed to know that?
Have fun.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
He's a big one. You two tight?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Did the police contact you?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
And you did that to protect my interest?
And where's Jackie?
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
'Ola!
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
Then what are you doing here?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No! Oh God.
Just to see you. That's all.
Stop!!!!
I could have told you that.
Just my luck.
They're not interested, Jake.
Maybe the demons are real.
Now what?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
You need ... a doctor.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
What did she have to say?
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I haven't seen her in months.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
It's freezing.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
No. Don't move me.
Where is the lamp?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
They're weird names.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Why you left.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
How's it going?
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
Get your clothes off!
That's your decision.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Here. I'll do it.
Am I home?
What?
What? What do you mean?
Stay away from me, Jez.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Long time ago.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
I no from around here.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Total delirium.
Call my chiropractor.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
A long time.
You've seen them?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Died?
Bring it in.
He doesn't like it.
Pour it in.
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
He came for me, I had to run!
The hull's imploding!
I don't know!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
And now we're all out of it.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Not a chance.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
I hope so.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Med-kit?
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
I think so, why?
I know you.
I'm stuck!
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Oh I like her a lot.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Again?! Jesus!
NO!
Just get us to the ship!
Small brains make your balls itch?
Let's just get out of here.
I'm just saying.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
You need to get laid!
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Ssh.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
What have I done?! Idiots.
You got it.
I know who he is...
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Full throttle! To port!
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Older, sillier.
Where is he?
Michael! Come inside!
Thank you.
What'll I tell the kids?
Do I need any more authority?
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
No, we just checked the beach...
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
Rogue?
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
So would I. Come on in.
He's busy.
I've got all these signs here...
Transplants?
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Anti-Shark cage.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
And I'll drink to yours.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
I'm supposed to be running.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Were we together?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Huh?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Yeah. That was me.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Okay.
I don't really know anything about it.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
I wrote that.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
You know... it's parts...
You don't have to do that.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Why?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Is Vanessa here?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What?
No?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
This is the baby. Your baby.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
You mean like couples?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Thundercats are go!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I am a suicide risk.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Unfortunately, yes.
That is sick, man.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
What?
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
They're yellow.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Hm.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Yeah, downtown.
Not really.
So you don't do any of those things.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
You can?
Do what?
Early, you are so sweet.
As many times as it takes.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Early, sing me a song.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Walter Livesy.
What do you need a Bible for?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Who?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
Yeah.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
What happened to Adele?
Thanks. What are you doing?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
A book on the warehouse murders?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Lighten up...
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
I don't want to talk about it.
Fuck!
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
What are you going to do?
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
No.
...You're hurting me...
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
Who are you?
Where would we find him?
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Yeah.
What?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
You think?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
Fifteen for me.
Yeah.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Come on.
I like you too.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
How do you know?
Do you care about me?
Because, you know why. You know.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Why is that?
What?
One.
No.
I tested positive?
But I only had sex with Telly.
You're OK?
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
No.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Yeah?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
I know.
Mine?
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Making love is like.
Yeah.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
You think so?
He still does.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
What?!
But then I won't need your money.
Nah.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Yes.
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
No.
Maybe you should.
I wouldn't know.
Then what's he talking about?
I'm positive.
Local?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
It's a voice modulator.
Did you know her?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Then call them!
The police haven't told you?
I've figured out the message.
Thanks.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
I just can't believe it.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Okay.
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Nothing.
Six, eight hours tops.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
What did he mean by Huxley?
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
He knows you're aware of that.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
What are they, please?
Uh huh.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
I don't think I could.
You sound like my mother.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
That's not fair!
No.
Because I think he's wrong.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
No.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
What's wrong?
What?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
It could be anything.
Frank told me.
Of course not.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Colwyn ...
You must move away from the Center.
All directions are the same here.
Does the Queen live?
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You won't have to.
He has come for Lyssa.
Yes.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
You're coming with us.
We must enter the swamp.
Saddles.
Yes.
I ache with it.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
He saved our lives.
I have need of friends.
You and I will guard the fire.
That I promise you.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
No.
A small house.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
I'd wish for a puppy.
I only want one.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
No. He will master the leader.
Then look!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
That I am, my lady.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
Many have perished in that maze.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Fewer will survive them.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
It is too late. He has drunk.
That is true.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Of what?
No.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Yeah.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Do you need money?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Whoever.
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
Mathilda?!
What shall we do?
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
A little...
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
...Don't you like me?
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
...Yes.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
I have no fear.
Messina.
Salute.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
Where?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
I have new dreams now.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
I'll make it.
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
How serious is it?
What?
Thank you.
Can it kill me?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
Okay.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
You like to take walks?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
Nine.
Mammoth.
Umm, Coalville Utah.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
She knew you loved her.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
What, come on?
I do.
Where am I?
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
Hello.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
Evening News?
What are my choices?
No.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Are you serious.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
It's me, Yuri.
Yuri... are you...
I have a 4.0.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Go to hell.
Are we done for today?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
Yes.
Because they got wet.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
Yes, I am.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
-- uh --
See?
Aristotle.
I'm so happy for you!
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
You think?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Maybe not to your face...
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
For a butt-head? Yes.
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Of course, I do!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
No, silly. I go here.
Do anything exciting?
Thank you. Having fun?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Thank you.
Yes.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Cunnilingus?
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
Not from me, surely...
I am afraid of nothing.
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Oh, yes...
What will become of me then?
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
And, now?
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
East of Mercia?
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
There must be an answer somewhere.
Will you lead me to her?
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Whatever for?
What know you of fields of war?
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
There's the way, mates.
We'll find it.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Mean you to seek him out below?
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
I've not heard a note out of you.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
They'll do nicely.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Never.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Stop complaining.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
What's the matter?
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My own father...
I don't want it on me.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
You've freed me, Jack...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
In the dark... where I join him...
Lili... I love you!
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Thought the weather terrible of late.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Sorry.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Jest with me then.
And as barren of love as stone.
Heading north still?
We wait.
I think she's about to foal.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
Here, honey!
What's wrong?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Has he eaten anything at all?
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
Who are all these people?
Nope.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
He jumped into the ocean.
I'll get your back.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
Why are you so stupid?
What?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
If that's what it takes.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
Thank you.
Yes, it is.
Not a shower.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
The plumber's due out on Friday.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You're so predictable.
It'll be fine.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I don't know.
I might have a solution.
The gloves on the table are for you.
How do you become something you're not?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
Oh.  Sorry.
She's a little sad, is all.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
You let him pierce his nose?
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
What did you do with your dog?
But you can't call me while you think?
Why call me?
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I'm married.
I don't have a phone.
Well, for later then.
Sam's favorite.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I think so.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I can hire workers to help me.
I can't pick you up.
So could I.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Not a perfect day.
No.
Don't even...I'm there.
Who?
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
We should take a vacation.
What?
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
You can't go because of Sam?
I never asked for more.
Please don't leave me.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Either do you.
I didn't go in your room.
This is what he wants.
Someone stop her!
Is Mae Rose okay?
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
That's because I've never been here before.
Claude Banks.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Nothing.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
He does it all by himself.
What about you, Radio?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
Yeah.
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
I'm stuck!
Say what?
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Let me see that.
Make 'em throw strikes.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Don't touch that car.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Why ain't that pick swinging?
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
It'll be too late.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
Satchmo.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
You mother...
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Urr... uggg... errr...
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Show him Central Park.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
You're already there...
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
I think you're looking at him.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
You did it for Namath.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Oh, would you grow up.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
"Octopus people?"
School?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
That was Cassius!
I love you.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
I don't know?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
From? From? From?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Where do you send them?
Up there.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Just the face.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Just wondered... what happens?
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
I'm in my party mood.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Did you?
Anybody we know?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
How a Sandman lives.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Of course --
You're not going, are you?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
How will they know we're coming?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Of course.
It could be...
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
Beloved wife...
Mother and Father said so... you know?
I don't know.
No.
I don't know... but it does.
Hello.
Gracious... no.
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
No, no, no
Stay? They lived together all their years?
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
What do you mean by that?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Yeah.
Yeah... Laurent.
You know what I think?
I don't know.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Are you positive he knows?
So what do we do?
I used to.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?... What else?
Alice, I...
We killed him.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Yes, I believe so.
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Sure.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Do ya good.
Sit down a minute.
The wife killer?
His physical condition.
Out in back.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
What's the word on the street?
We'll get a tail put on him.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
What about yesterday?
Coming up.
He won't give his name.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
FUCKIN' "A".
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
That's absurd.
Alice who?
What are you going to do?
Wake me up when you get home.
Maybe.
What night?
Called? When?
I guess so.
Thanks, guys.
I wish I knew.
Why would anyone do something like this?
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
I can see that.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Yeah?...
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Sure.
I don't know.
I don't want to talk about it...
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I do like you, Sheila.
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Thank you.
Fossils.
Uh-huh.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Yes!
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Sounds like a stall to me.
Okay, Lovey.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
I'll say.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
It's unbelievable.
Gold. You were going to—
All right.
No.
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
Yes, charming.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
No.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Hey!
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Mine?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Yes, Bob.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
Dead?
That's what you said.
All right. Sorry, George.
Porters?
Is that all my story meant to you?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
Oh, George . . .
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Yes, everything!
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
In for what?
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
That was easy. I read your books.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Yes, I know.
I wonder.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Bump?
Why?
Struggling, why?
Why?
I'd love it!
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
Yes.  Barney!
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Perhaps.
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
What the hell...
And Goodwill Toward Man?
And if I say yes?
What happens if I say no?
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Actually, sir--
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Kay...
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Right.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
You don't know the half of it.
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
We're rising.
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
I'd double it and add 20.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Will it lower the curve?
May I have a look?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Oh shit!
Don't tell me.  Insects.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Can you see?
They're inside.
Anderton, leave.
Anderton --
Someplace safe.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Oh, Jesus...
Found?  Where?
Because I found out about her...
We know each other?
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
Drowning.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Hang on, Lamar --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
We won't let them.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Everybody runs.
Because it was going to fall.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Rufus.  She's a precog.
I guess that's all of it.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
Wanna hear something funny?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
Hold your breath, Dad...
Who said I would?
You're not gonna kill me...
And how did Lamar become involved?
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
The safest place of all.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
The female.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
What?
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
How?
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
I don't know, why?
How many?
Knott!
Sure.  Raincheck.
Yes.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
So?
Is it the good room?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
No.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
Bullshit.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
She's, uh, sleeping.
He's not doing it.
What time is it there?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
Yeah, sure.
She'll be out in a minute.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
That's it.
Where's Ricky.
Me? No. Not really.
Pshhh...
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
I don't understand.
Ruiz knows about this?
He'll work it off.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Where's the drop?
Yeah.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Ricky's taken care of.
He's not here.
I got no idea.
I thought you hate that club.
We don't need guns.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Nothing.
They asked who it was.
Don't even start.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
I mean, that's what I heard --
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Fuck this.
Back in.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Where?
C'mon, man...
The what?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
Eighty bucks?!?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Let's just go now and wait.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Tom. How's it going?
You want your surprise?
Well, come on then. It's back here.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
You see a Ricky Slade?
What?
Ugh...
Where do you live?
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Here...
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Word.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Outfit? What's he talking about?
What?
That's none of your fucking business.
And where might that be?
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Heard where?
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
You know it.
I don't want your money.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Read it and keep on reading.
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
I can handle it.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
The talk is everywhere!
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I'm tired of praying.
Let some of us come down there.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Yes, sir, I did.
Say what you're saying.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
How long has this been going on?
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Well, all reet, then.
Eat lead, coppers.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
So what about him?
Might be all right.
That's right.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Are you sure?
Allah will provide.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
Where?
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[No!]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Who are you?]
[Who's he?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[You stole the drop.]
[The ransom was ten.]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Nothing wrong.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
I said the plan was right here.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Time will tell.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Yes.
You need to practice.
I dropped her at home.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Frank. Frankie.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Dyslexic?
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Then don't come.
It's Creasy.
She understands men.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
That's ridiculous.
He has to go.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
So am I.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
What?
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
Yeah, sure.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Where?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
It's her baby too, you know.
Well, it ain't your baby.
You told me.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Nothing.
Okay.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure, what?
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
What, Ma?
You want a beer, Ang'?
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
I don't wanna talk about it!
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Back home.
Look at that right eye.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
What the hell's going on here?
And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Right.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
An eternal damnation.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
I don't get it.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
I think we could still have a chance.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Ayuh.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
You're leaving tomorrow?
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Why would he do that?
Yeah!
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
You can cut the bow.
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Oh, get out of here!
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
What's that, Henry?
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Um-hum.
With all of it?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
No.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Me?
About me?
Yes, sir.
Thirty dollars.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
The Websters.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
What's that?
Oh!
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
What John Doe?
Well, you're catching on.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
That's—
I ain't seen him for a week.
I used to pitch.
Shut up!
Both of 'em?
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
The heelots!
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Why—uh—
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear—and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
How?
Shh!
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
Deal.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
What happened, Mike.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Is that all?
Yeah.
I know.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Why? You like my ass?
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Okay, stop.
I do.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Yeah, first and second.
We lost.
How much you wanna bet?
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Good question.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
You worship yourself.
Can I come in?
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
What do you want from me?
You got a bet on the game tonight?
Yeah that's it.
Scottie...
And you think he'll...
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
What?
Define concern.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Who's running it!
Yeah, they are but...
I need to take back what's mine.
Yes, I believe he has --
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
About what?
No...
Yes.
Wake up?!
No.
It's not real.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
At least a day.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
That's right.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Katie was digitized.
Insurance.
If she's alive, you get it back.
No.
Her?
I know.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
There?
Just like that?
Checking connection.
-- Waiter.
-- Standard.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
They're called squirbs.
WHITE TIGER!
... I just pray we're not too late.
I think so.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
Release the power with the power.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
LET'S FLY!
A real shame.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
How about Major Moron?
Wait for me!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
You want me to place a few calls?
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
What do you mean "basically"?
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Activating Power Scope!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
And I ain't no nigger either!
But I've never served a day.
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Scared.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Could we step outside?
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
You got men on Profaci's place?
How's Bugsy doin'?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I can just imagine.
It's a mask.
Why? You're the innocent one.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
I'm doin' business here!
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
I told you twenty!
Who?
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Don, I'd be honored.
The name's Charlie.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
I turned him down flat.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Anything!
Just wanted ta say hello.
I didn't say anything.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Bend over?
Thank me next time you see me.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
A piñata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
Tell me what?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Give me a date, Doctor.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
All right. You can come.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
What pictures?
Mother!
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
... Manly?
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Would you settle for a husband?
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
What do I play?
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Do we *have* to?
What?
Okay--I mean--
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
What is it?
Great saints!
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Me! Jim--how--?
Y-yes, Jim.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Oh, a *boy*!
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Than what?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Here--where are you running off to?
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Will he yield for a question?
Will he *yield*?
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
Office of--Senator Smith?
The man downstairs said number--
Most natural thing in the world!
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Tonight.
Why?
What's that?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Try sitting down.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
No complaints.
Go right ahead.
I also answer to whistles.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Not another bill?
Do you want to dictate them?
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Wait--
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Goodnight, Senator--
Yes, sir--
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
What do you mean? What's going on?
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Go away, Nosey.
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Okay. See you here.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Oh, now--that won't do--
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
Yes--
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Just a minute, Joe!
Maybe he won't get up.
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Deeds?
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Uh-huh.
Yes, you own it.
Your Honor!
No!
Yes!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
It's wonderful.
Huh?
That depends on what they see.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Oh, that—
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
Sure!
I'll get my hat.
Let's just walk, okay?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Nothing.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Come on - let's go!
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
Let me go!
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
What was that you said he was?
Proceed.
But your honor—
Wants to know who the heir is.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
What?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Who - me? No.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
No, thanks.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
What're you talking about?
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Shut up!
They can have the Estate.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Me?!
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
No, I mean - about my client.
Huh?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
I write poetry.
Oh, the poet? Where?
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Yeah. What?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
What's that?
Oh, I do too, sir.
I did what!
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
Looking for?
Who?
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
No!  What do you want!!
What happened?
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
What's that?
I'm fine.
Not any more.
Ernest, what do you think?
...And I from Phyllis.
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Good, then go.
Henry!
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Go to hell.
You are so mean.
My pleasure.
Do you want to come in?
I've had my moments.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
You've done well.
Tastes good.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
My patient had to leave early.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
...so accomplished.
He told you.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Oh... not a real doctor.
What do you mean?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Maybe you'll catch it.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
That's one way to put it.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
You're not the only one...
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
What?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Will you wait for me?
Weekly or monthly?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
That's not quite what I said --
What do you want me to see?
Was it something that happened at school?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Nah... scotch.
Is that the question?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Don't you like this?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
All new people start with that...
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
What'd I do?
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
When?
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
You always did have more balls than brains.
You shall see.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
What is he doing here?
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
Twenty.
Broad?!
No.
If you call that a kiss.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
I know my treasure.
Oh that's comforting.
No you're not.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
That just makes you more gullible.
Way to go, Evy.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Yes,... I see.
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
Except for one little thing.
Fantasizing... about you.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
I can't.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Let's do it.
It's me... Elizabeth.
He's dead.
I got it.
You're nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Against.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Really?
Really?
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Roy.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Monica!
Yes.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
Yeah.
But there's still only six of us.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
So you're chicken?
Shhh.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Oh shut up.
Come on.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Mother... it's not what you think!
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Or both.
Whatever our name is.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
With or without him, we gotta go!
May the forks be with us!
Proceed.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
May I come to the map?
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Are you serious?
Cavalry?
Where are they?
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
Fair enough.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
Come back in an hour.
Come in.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Ajaccio.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Lisette.
No...
Not even the slightest hint of something?
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Of course.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
What are you doing in there?
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
What are you talking about?
I wrote it.
God help me -- yes.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Yes, I do -- very much.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
That is a matter of opinion.
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
You paid cash?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Yes you did.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
What happen?
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
What about the dog?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
I can't taste nothing.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
You don't know Baby D.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
You walked?
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
Ain't no windows in here.
That ain't gonna work.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
I don't know.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Why didn't she put'em out?
It's locked.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
I'll remember.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
You damn right that's the big one.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
This is a knock.
And some rolling papers.
I don't know.
He's a boy, dude.
Call me.
20 minutes?
I got fired too.
I don't know.
I don't know, Debo.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Yeah.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
What urgent message?
That ain't gonna work.
I don't know the number.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Huh?
I don't know.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Oooh, ba-by!
Elroy.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
That's my girl.
What?
Business.
My security people are right next door.
No.
I would also like to apologize.
For not believing you.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Good.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
No, please...
I want'to talk to her.
Don't you threaten me.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
Nods.
All right.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
What?
What are you supposed to do?
What are you going to do?
Yeah.
What!?
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't think so.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Laughs.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
You're a big girl, huh?
It better be.
Go ahead, sugar Die.
'Daddy has to go now.
No.
He carried on some; kicked.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Not even her?
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
She went.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
How do you mean?
Sshhh! He's in there.
All to pieces!
Bluebeard!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Tricked us!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
Mister Powell!
You better not sing that song.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Yes, I reckon that's it.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
She talks to herself.
He ain't my Dad.
Is that all?
Huh?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Yes. Yes.
I'll tell.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Yonder.
Under the stone in the floor.
You could save him, little bird.
What secret shall I tell?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
All right.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Can I have this?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Our honeymoon.
She turned me out of the bed.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
I was praying.
Harry, what --
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
She took them kids with her?
None of your business, Madam.
Now who was this?
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
Uh-oh...
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Hi.
My dream.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Deal.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Okay.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Go on...
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
Just sleep now, Mom.
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
The door was locked from your side.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
You should be more careful, Anna.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
What was it like?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
That's right.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
That's another thing... it's spring.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Monsieur.
Which part of the room is mine?
I must be stern with you.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
We have opened a restaurant...
The Duchess...
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Oh, yes, yes.
Good morning, Gaston.
That's all right.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Go to bed.
That's perfect!
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
What did she say about me?
Two thousand francs.
A day.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Look for yourselves.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
You believe in our cause?
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
No visa.
Oh no. No visa.
You might hold this for me.
I'll try.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
Go ahead.
Yes.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Ni-notchka.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
The bayonet? Did you really?
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
You know I want to...
At what?
Yes.
My darling.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
A funny story?
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
No, no music.
But I can throw it out of the window.
Please.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Good morning, Swana.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
What does he say?
No.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
You can't imagine.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
In that case I can only say good-by.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
What do you want?
Why?
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
May I ask why?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
This will do. 
Raw carrots and beets.
Where is that?
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Yes ... I got the money.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
I thought the gloves were off.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
So?
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
Yes, you approved it, sir.
"Security" is not strong enough.
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Money.  Follow the money.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Let him finish, Bob.
Is it my turn?
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
What ... ?
Harold ... can I get you anything?
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
I know ...
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
I won't tell him if you won't.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
We'll see about that.
The American people put me where I am.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Yeah ...
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Did you cry when he died?
Why?
How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
... but it was all we had.
You're shittin' me.
Syracuse.
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
The hell with 'em.
Well, we could delete it.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
Is that the truth?
Do you really want this, Dick?
Then I'll be there for you.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I've missed you.
Yes, it's been a long time ...
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
They're all your enemies?
You personally?
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Thank you.
Lost.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
The "crises"?
Whatcha mean by that?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
Yes, you've circled round.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
Uh-huh.
Oh yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Would you tell me if you had?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
The old boy shot by the highway?
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Gun out and up.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Believe you're right.
Sheriff?
I don't know. He ought to...
Yes sir.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
That's very nice.
Well I didn't see it.
Yes. Things fall into place.
Just keep it up.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
I shall return.
Where does he work?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I don't know. Will there?
With what?
Well...
You live in that house behind the store?
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Call it?
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
No.
...Where you want me to put it?
Uh-huh.
Somethin' like that.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Yessir. I understand that.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
Yes?
What else then?
How would you describe him?
Not any way.
I'm a welder.
You do, I reckon.
No sir.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Yeah?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
I know plenty.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
I don't think I am.
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, me too.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
You're late, Eric.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
I got you, Del...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
I begged him to let me put that on!
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
What's his real name?
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
Man, that is love.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
The one you were telling me about?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
How many men have I talked to?
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
He is real.
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Ahh... my wife's.
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
No...
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
...and put them in your mouth.
He told us it's in the Buick.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
What 'look'?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
Should I kill him now?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
Worse... you're in Texas.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
What's wrong with you?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
It is, if you like idiots...
He's waiting...
"Injuns?"
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I'll think about it.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Waitaminute -
- and share one of your graves.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Oh my God!
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
That's good, honey.
- in the gods - Huh?
You -
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
Aw, that's all right.
But... but...
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Yes, sir.
Great.
What for?
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
I never said any of that!
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
A long time ago.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Pity you don't have the character.
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
Yes, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Well, goodbye.
I didn't call you anything before that.
Zack, don't!
Yes, sir!!
Yes, sir!
I said, come here!
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
I'm a little late, that's all.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
One more minute.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Great.
No way... Would you?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
He didn't give you much choice.
Be a friend. Leave.
You're better than candy.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Why'd he do it?
I can't risk it.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
He said he grew up poor?
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
I've seen better.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Naw.
A little.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
She didn't.
God.
I can't...
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
That's their problem.
Pure idiot.
Shut up.
Shut up and let me think.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
I don't get it.
Can we come in?
We'd like to come in.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
I said open the door.
0150.
That room!
What do they want?
Shaky?
Chills?
I am.  I'm here.
"Titanic."
Shhh...
Blue is phones?
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Fuck that, we've got company...
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
You know that's bullshit.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Cy... I ain't even sure.
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
I don't know.
No man. Gonna walk.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Yeah.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
And who is we?
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Where is he?.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I don't know. I really don't.
No.
You call that a compliment?
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Thank you.
As do you.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Yes, sir.
Oh?
I will do so as soon as possible.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Sir.
Oh?
Is that so?
You know how old I am.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Where?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
That's five, keep going...
Gabriel.
I am, I think.
When?
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Remember Braddock?
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Bite?
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
I'm sure you're not.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
I don't know.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
What did we do, Jud?
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Remember.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Did you see his shirt?
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
And Church will be fine.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
Yes, I guess I do.
She.  Goes.  Free.
You can't.  I can.
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
He didn't waste it.
That so?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Very well.
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
What?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Yes -- yes.
Ceremony?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
Yes, the rum is gone.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
That he is.
We're catching up!
I know.  That was for the smell.
How did he get off the island?
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Indeed.
No.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Good.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
Aye!  Avast!
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
It's the right way.
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes, I have.
... No.
Speak.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
If you loved me like I loved you?
That might work.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
A man?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
You know, this and that.
The nanobot.
What happened to it?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Yes.
We don't?
What happens?
Three days ago it was.
No, why?
No, no, I just feel wired!
What about it!
Blame the victim.
The nanobot... it's not here...
I don't know.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
Oh yes you are!
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes, he might be.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Goodbye, Stew—
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
So, it's obvious, huh?
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Are you crazy?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Is that so?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
I certainly will.
I'm afraid.
Yeah?
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Yeah?
With me you can always do business.
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Do you call yourself a reporter?
Yes, sir.
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
I'm not quitting!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Holy jumping swordfish!
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Surely, come right in.
You don't.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Are the cars ready?
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Have you seen this? 
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Now the lady said you may go—
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
That's all I wanted to know!
Very good, sir.
Thanks.
Yeah?
It can't be possible.
In my handbag.
Looks just like it did.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Thanks ... I love you.
I'm sorry ...
Here's my favorite.
I've got to go ...
No ...
I was in a bowling-alley.
No I'm not.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
No I'm not sweetie.
Where are you gonna go?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Oh, gosh no.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
What's the matter?
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
Oh, no thanks ...
"Changes."
Thank you very much.
Yes I do.
Still doesn't make it right.
What?
No way.
What's going to happen?
Owns the hardware store.
To who?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
I don't think so.
... Yeah.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Honestly ... no.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
You don't know?
What?
Yeah.
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
They just grow like that?
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
It was a prop for the school play ...
No I won't. I swear.
I like it too.
McGinty's.
I can't.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Why?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
I'm so glad you're here.
What?
Listen to me!
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Just listen to me ...
Forget about that!
... What's that?
I brought you something ... From the library.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
D&D Mattress Man.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Hello everyone.
Did I say that?
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I'm sorry.
It's fine, but --
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
Call me later.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Are you watching a porno movie?
Do you like porno movies?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
Where is she?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Can I ask you a question?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
I didn't lie.
This is not cool.
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
No.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
It's terrible, no.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Ok.
Sure.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
...yes I did...?
...yeah...
If you come to Hawaii --
This is Lena.
...I don't know what you mean....
Thank you.
Yes.
This is funny.
I'm fine are you ok?
You can't do that.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
For what?
Did you do it?
I didn't do it.
Hello, how are you?
-- and this is confidential?
What?
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
Hi Walter.
I'm sorry.
It takes time to process --
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Hi, Lance.
You're goin' on a trip?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
Ok.
Please don't do this.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Is this where you live?
Alright, alright.
Well....what do you want, then?
You can't be late though.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Ok.
No.
I'm sorry. You're right.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
What? What've I done?
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
An innocent child is dead.
Why was it you never took her by force?
Was it impotence?
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
Of course.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
He's sworn to obedience.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
No. It most certainly was not.
That's not our intent --
What could cause a tincture like this?
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
And my own.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Quite.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
Is it terribly erotic?
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
No. But tell him I would.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I pray you: be succinct.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
....shame on you, truly...
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Very much.
Am I?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
My name is Orson Welles
I'll remember that.
Randolph!
Over at RKO?
Yeah
You know that can't happen.
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I wanted it
You will not walk out on me
I can't remember the lines!
We're using-
Uh-huh
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Showing life
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Like a bug.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
We're doing Hearst.
So speaks the court jester.
I expected more from you.
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
Don't do this
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
Kinda.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Get out.
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
Jesus
Please don't ask me to do this.
Then find another theater
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
It was fun, wasn't it?
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
How can he embarrass you?
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
What?
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
You want the title shot or not?
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Well, that's what I mean.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Whadda ya mean?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Should I hit it?
No.
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Nobody. I love you, remember?
What did I do?
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
I took the kids to my sister's.
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
You did?
Yeah --
Are you drunk?
Jake, sit down for a minute.
C'mon, Tommy --
He should.
He has it. Thank you.
Jefferies?
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
I'll bet it's been done.
All right -- you don't believe me.
Who left -- where?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Mrs. Thorwald.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
For getting rid of that cast.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Did you get my note?
Why should I?
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
You've got a hormone deficiency.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
No.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
She pay you much?
How did you know!
I was.
And some man will lose his.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Smart girl.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
I think it's enchanting.
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Three.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Something too frightful to utter.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
What's the apartment house number?
Someone not his wife?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Too close.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
Your name?
A new disease.
What?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Smashed the front door.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Shoot, Jimbo.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
I don't want to learn that!
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Sorry.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Just relax, please relax!
I still think you should go down.
Head-shrinker?
I'll wait for him.
Hi there.
What?
Jim.  What's yours?
I know.  That's why I came back.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
No.  In the morning.
What's a chickie-run?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
Come on!
Man, you're schizoid!
Who?
I'm fine.
They like you.  Okay?
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
All right, darling.
Mom--I'm not--
What's that got to do with it?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Grandma?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Now that's true!
Who lives?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
You don't need to do that.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
It's all right.
No.
What?
No.  Why?
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Gabriel, let him go --
YES!!!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
...whoever she is.
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
What the fuck is going on.
Nick --
You told him about Nick's letters.
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
Don't say my name...
I'm almost done.
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
I shared his cell!
She says a lot of things.
Bam Bam.
Christmas... Eve...
I said, who the hell made the map?
Why not.
More than you know.
Might as well be.
At least gimme video poker.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Get out.
...never... tried...
What's the code?
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
And where they hide the real money.
Show's over.
I don't steal any --
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
My what?!
Not with you.
How do we take them out?
I promise you, I didn't know!
It's a roach, guy --
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Yeah.
I'm just saying.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Thought you hate your old man.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
What, working security?
Alamo...
How'd you know I'd do it.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
What? No...
There is no other table --
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Who?
Where was she from, Compton?
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Bullshit.
Pam Grier.
Yeah.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
You can do some crazy things with it.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Don't ask me that.
He don't believe in it.
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
It's not good...
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
I don't know anybody.
Well, he knows a little about me.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
We don't think this place is safe.
Yeah, those guys too.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
As far as -- Sonora?
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
It's too light yet.
What?
All right -- it's said!
It's going to Sonora.
Maybe they will.
Goodbye, Mary.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
Which ranch?
I don't want to run short.
Yes.
All right. I'll tell you.
And meet him there.
Swimming.
How'd you happen to miss?
You better start.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
All right, you didn't know.
What's there to be fair about?
I said I didn't care.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Then why stay in the hills.
Yeah.
They went on like I told you.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Depends on how good you drive.
And we're running out of that.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Stop it --
I don't know -- I don't know.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Lookin' around.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Would they be good to eat?
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Do I know you?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Open chest!!!
It looks like the furnace.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Huh?
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
What, you think I did this to myself?
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Made you say it!
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Uh, uh.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I wouldn't go that far.
Saw who?!
Are these all the subjects?
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
What is it, Dwight?
I guess so.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
You said you hated him.
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
I'm so happy I could shit.
You mean for TV or print?
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Yes, I did.
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
No, I don't.
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Yes you are.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
What's he know?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Where?
You think my sister is there?
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
Yes.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
She could use a hundred dollars.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
But I like teaching school.
Nothing.
Yes.
Good.
But you do believe me?
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
Gregory ——  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
I have something even better.
But you're always at the library.
I'm at sea, Jason.
I keep telling myself that.
I understand.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
Yes —— and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I don't believe it.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Television?
No.
Kids? What about them?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Agreed.
Impotent.
What kind of personal project?
Who's Donna?
Why not?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Yes.
Don't you want to make one?
It won't. Are you ready?
Absolutely not.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
Yes.
What was the problem?
How come?
And now you can?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I'm not planning on it.
Why not?
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
No.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Who'd you have lunch with?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Always the lawyer.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Yes!
Yes.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Did you find him attractive?
I guess.
He doesn't have a phone.
But he won't.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Why did you do that?
You touched him?
Hold on.
Well. I can't stay.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
What do you get?
Not exactly.
Talking.
Whichever you prefer.
Yes.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
So make an exception.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
In here!!
Cynthia. John.
I want to see you.
Right now.
She's there? What's she doing there?
You told Ann about this?
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
You trust him.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Did he put you up to this?
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
It'll just be me.
You have family here also?
Brian Kirkland, please.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
OK. But late.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Gonna cut me open?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
Did I say anything?
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
NIGHT NIGHT
He needs help.
I've caught it once or twice.
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Who trusts experts?
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Everything's free there.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Who?
YOUNG BLOOD
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Fabulous!
Fast!
What does he know about it?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
We're not confused.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Huh.
Gary.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah.
Not so bad yourself.
Maybe. Recognize this?
Well, in that case...
I can't help the traffic.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
You said you had it all lined up.
Yeah, Conundrum.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Let me call Christine.
Now we're talking.
Want some?
It's not even a mile.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
So you're going to stop acting?
Uh-huh.
If that's what feels right.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know that chick?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Miles.
What?
Aye-aye, captain.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
We were supposed to play golf.
She's been leaving messages here too.
I will.  See ya!
What?
Deep.
You're an asshole.
Shut up.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Slaughterhouse.
Put me down, Jack.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I don't have to.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
Whatever. Sorry.
Back at you.
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Yeah, I know.
How long have you been into wine?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
Yeah.
Got it.
Good. So did I.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
About a year.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
Does she ever answer back?
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
It tastes funny.
My ballet recital.
I don't feel much.
...I will.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Just make noises then.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
I got him.
Ray Reddy's house.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
We have to go in the basement.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
Have they said anything about our area?
Me too.
Graham.
Edgar, come inside.
I have some upstairs.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
Bimboo?
I just asked his name.
What's two?
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Don't yell at her!
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
Sounds like a virus.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
No money, eh?
It was my fault.
Where were you?
I'm sorry.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Right.
It's one thing to know it...
I already did that.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Ten A.M.
I'll be long gone.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
I'm going to California with my brother.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
What now?
He'll be here.
Let's get out of here.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
Who did it?
You don't know?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
So we understand each other?
Stella.
Why'd you go into business with him?
That's the good stuff.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Who?
I am telling the truth.
I'm glad we talked.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Spare me.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Almost right.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
If it's on the page...
I'll send you her resume.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Simone does not control my destiny.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Soon.  Soon.
Viktor, you should have said something.
You're so good to protect her like this.
No.
Do what?
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Just a minute.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
How about the nudity?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Hello, Hal.
Body double.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
I know what you mean.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
Good for you, Hank.
I've seen them all before.
What's that?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I do.
Precisely.
Night, Lainey.
I noticed.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
What?!
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
Er,... good.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
She looks a lot like you.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Why?
Dark?
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
You're in breach.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Taller, Viktor.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
Yes.
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
Good.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
--Do I know you?
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Dr. Crowe.
If it's okay with you?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
You mean aneurysm.
That I'm a freak.
What?
Who me?
I forgot myself.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
Don't fail me.
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
You do?
I guess she did.
What?
Don't get mad.
Maybe.
They did?
Oh my God.
Yes.
Standing next to my window.
Dead people.
They want me to do things for them.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
It's our pleasure.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Bitch.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
The band.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Bus broke down.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
"-- an AXE!"
Harvest moonshining!
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
This is his room... isn't it?
I don't think so.
Amends...?
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
What's wrong?
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
Whatcha' doin'?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Hey, Grant.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Aspirin.
Okay.
You took Bill.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Sorry.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Brought you munchies.
All the rib eyes?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Out.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Margaret.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
You know how rumors start.
How much style?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
Okay.
Driving?
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Ciao.
Like what?
And?
Bandit II?
You gotta admire the man's determination.
No.
But I still don't think...
Go.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Can a pig whistle?
What's your twenty?
What does the old Timex say?
I'm at marker eight-five.
Now what?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Yeah, but...
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
That's the point, Dickey.
Now, you just find him, son.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Ww... uh...
And threw us into the lake.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
...About what?
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
I left him a message.
Look at the collar on that coat...
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Only if you really, truly mean it.
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
...He does now...
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
I don't see it like that at all.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Yeah, I can front this.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
Like a mafucka.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
What are we talkin' on the split...
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
What?
What's the time frame?
A puppet.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
How quickly?
What?
What was it?
And professionally?
I don't know.
What is it?
Human beings can die.
Get out --
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Into what?
I love her.
Why?
To calm your anxiety.
Yes.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
How old were you?
I did too.
You don't know?
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
You... she said I didn't love her.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Rheya.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Not this time.
It's all right.
I'm disgusting.
You should have told me.
Thank you.
I can't stay here.
I can't --
When?
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
No, Ma'am.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Hmm...
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
I can't open it.
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
I don't know.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Do you dance?
Yeah.
Mike...?
Yeah.  It's all over.
I don't know...
Not if you don't want me to.
... I don't want to talk about it...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Nothing.
Sure we are, let's go!
I don't know Tommy.
Too kinky.
What?
What are you talking about?
Get in bed.
Oh, some shit.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
I might stop you.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
I had to follow her to a store.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
You talked to his wife?
I just sat and listened.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Lay back, Mack.
We're gonna pass the street.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Be nice.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
No. No, that's okay.
Remember Little League?
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Harry…
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Don't be pitiful.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Hmf-hrr?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
I-- uh--
Thank God.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
But you like that in a man?
Does it have a human name?
Do you mind if I come too?
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Actually, I got this spider bite…
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
What?
Bonkers.
No, no!  Not there!
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Plenty.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Looks good outside.
That'll do.
Who is it?
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Take it.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Yeah.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Then droppen Sie dead!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
It's a mouse trap.
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Let me go!
Me? What if she don't want me?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
What do they always say?
Do Jimmy Durante!
Animal! Got a little something for you!
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Says who?
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Give this to Joey, will you?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Ich weiss alles.
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Not particularly.
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
One minute to warp core breach.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
I hope so, sir.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
Yes, yes, it is.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
I hadn't planned on it.
That's right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
And what would that be, sir?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
I thought you might.
I always do.
I was ordered to by the Captain.
No, I didn't know that.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
Nothing. As before.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Locate.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
I'll handle that later.
I have already made one transmission too many...
Not exactly.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Goodbye, David.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
About a dozen officers and men.
Come on!
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!

He would not have spoken of it openly.
... Yes...
... The needs of the few...
Understood, my lord.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
How is that...?
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
And who am I hiding from?
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Mother, go back!
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
What's the matter -- ?
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I see. Helmsman?
What?
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
Only half of you would get there.
I don't know.
Raise them --
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Visual --
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Chekov, who is this man?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Aye, sir --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
A few shots, sir.
I'm going down to the station.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Try the emergency channels...
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Give the word, Admiral.
Admiral, this is Spock.
I am understandably curious.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
To be sure, Captain.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
The power of creation --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Spock...!
... No, sir. It has not.
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
There is no such regulation.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
Aye, sir.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Phasers locked...
Aye, sir.
By the book...
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Where must you go?
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
What do you mean?
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Not me, Bones... They did it.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
Like what?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Name?
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
Hm?
All right. The truth?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You want the details?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Permission granted.
What is our target in time?
But you said toxic.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
How do you know this...?
Yes.
Yes?
The hell I can't
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
The tank will be finished by morning...
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Thank you, Spock.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
They did, Admiral.
I will, Admiral.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Steady as she goes...
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
About 60 feet, Admiral.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
How long, Scotty?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
No power to the bay doors.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
That's the ticket, laddie.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Sulu Hikaru.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Why?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
... an offlander?
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
Perhaps, that is true.
Really?
Sometimes I do.
Bye.
No.
From the mission...
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
A planet in Federation space...
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
Recommendations?
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Why not?
On screen.
Eject the core.
Remind me to lodge a protest...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Sir?
Beam him out!
I'm not letting go of him.
No, sir...
We have to find shelter...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Say the greeting again...
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
Good question.
Was I doing something to your neck?
... I believe you...
Augh?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Absolutely.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Bag him.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
No... no, please... you cannot...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Ready quantum torpedo.
I told you, there's no --
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Great name. French?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
There's a few of us left.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Some.
I have to...
That's impossible.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Life signs?
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
We've lost Bridge control!
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Where the hell are they going?
Riker here.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Commander... we have a problem.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
The charge is murder.
We've been set up all along.
I didn't mean this future.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Still think we're finished?
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Stand...?
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
That isn't true...!
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Who else?
Now we go to Starfleet?
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Onscreen.
Do we report this, sir?
We must do this again soon.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
They'll be here...
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Sulu!
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
What peace conference?
Why would they give them to us?
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
... is to trust him.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Who else?
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Faith...?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
An error.
I don't want to.
Visual!
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I think  not.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
I believe I am.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Because you are dangerous.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
Sorry, sir.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
Emergency force fields are holding.
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
With pleasure, Captain.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How could I not?
No!
You sick bastard!
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Understood.
Theories?
What do we know about the population?
What programs were accessed?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
Aye, sir.
Ready, sir!
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
Just lucky, Admiral.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Captain!
On screen.
Still well on our side...
Thank you, sir...
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
We can only hope so.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
No?
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
And the Senate supports you?
You know I do.
I know.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
He is what his life has made him!
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Let's go.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
Seven minutes.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
She is here.
They're holding position.
They will obey, Praetor.
I have a purpose.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
No, we can handle this.
I understand.
No.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Elmo's...
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
When can we expect containment?
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
Watch it. They're coming out.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Marc Shermin.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
X...
Money.
What are you doing?
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
I am Jenny Haydn.
You. Mouth closed.
You want to try it?
Shit!
Horses.
No.
Is that a baby?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I do not speak English.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Goodbye.
It was a mistake.
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
I don't understand 'friend.'
What is hell?
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
Where did you learn that?
No.
Yes.
I will say that we can be friends.
Many, many days and nights...
I must go.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
You could have killed us both!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
Very beautiful country up here...
It could have been anything.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
I don't understand.
You know that's impossible!
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
You're too goddamned paranoid.
You're going down.
My God.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
Step into my office.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Shutup a second!
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
Why me?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
What?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Strickland.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Let's talk in the car.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Black.  Jack.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
It's not your fault.
But that doesn't add, does it.
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
How long does it last?  Oh.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
You never told me.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
See you downtown.
Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
What?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
He had an orange hat on.
What's with the eyelids?
At the field office.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Just an observer.
This better be important.
From the grave?
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
Huh?, sir.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
Not especially.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
They're all criminals?
What's this country coming to?
Huh?
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You did.
What's that?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Suspect Zero.
And you're working with him?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
No weapon.
Yes.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
Zero killed them all?
How do you know who's real and who's not?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Sounds like fun.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
You're right. I know.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
What else is going on?
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
What an asshole.
...And she's with someone else.
Could you believe it?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Oh... right.
You want this in black chips.
Six years.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
...It's really getting late.
...get the hell outta here already...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
You don't call.
Right.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
No problem.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
I didn't want to say anything.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
Well, you're doing so well...
Make someone bleed.
Damned if I know...
...People get carjacked...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
When?
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
Whu?
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
Did she, or did she not smile?
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
Yea, how much?
Let's just leave.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
She smiled, baby.
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
What?
She thought you were money.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Yeah.
It starts at eight...
Minnie Pearl.
What?
A day.
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Oh. He's got it under control...
They're a finesse team...
...It's on.
No.
...you're money...
...Yeah.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...it's on.
Six.
America has been good to me...
Go back to your house and wait for me...
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
How bad will it be?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Sure.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
Should I bring him in.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
Maybe I can help.
For killing a man.
No.
Then why have I become a man like you?
How?
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
How do you know I come from America?
Shhhhh.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
No.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
I'm thinking about it.
I love you.
OK. 
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Let me think about it, O.K.?
Don't ask me.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
I can help you out...
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
Probably a year...
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Just be patient.
He talked to you?
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Sure. Any time.
Okay, darling.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
No, still here.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Your parents met her.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
I played piano in a few places.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
No!
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
Ripley's plans.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
So tell me.
I love Marge.
Aye, aye.
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
I think it might hurt her to know.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
What's going on?
He's not a man, he's a god.
Sure.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Ha. Did he say why?
I think you're right.
Dickie did it.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
To the manner born.
And you, sir? Any better?
I can explain.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I don't believe you.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
Emily.  Just kidding.
As in the...?
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I'll take them both.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
I'll fix some drinks.
You try. You try talking to her.
What do you want to change about this moment?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was who Meredith?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
Yes?
November 7th is my information.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Huh?
Yes, mam.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
I can believe that.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
I mean porno movies.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Hello, Betsy.
You forgot "sexy".
More people watch it.
With who?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
Show me how he did that again.
What is it? I'm busy.
Yeah.
You said that?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
You can do it in my mouth.
I can leave anytime I want.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
Cops don't do nothin.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
Yes.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
You moonlightin?
Why do you ask?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
You suppose?
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
The cell, Mason.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Oh...
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Shhhhhh.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Thanks.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Yes?
Oh, no, I...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Pete...
Wish I could say the same thing.
Huh?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Exactly.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Luke didn't smoke.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Oh.
Oh...
You bet, honey.
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
The war...
No.  Absolutely not.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Yes.
Yes?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Different?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Cathy!
Just listen to them!
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Is she all right?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Yes?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Okay.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Birds are not bad!
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Yes, very.
I told you. We met yesterday.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
I started to say... inside...
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Did you close the door?
Shhhh. Shhhh.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Well, I...
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
What for?
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Seven o'clock then.
Famished.
He was watching a ball game on television.
Yes.
Yes, I was lying.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
I'm glad you do.
No, tell me.
No, thank you.
Growing a beard...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
Don't let's take any chances.
The bay doesn't.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Inland.
Mitch...
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
You said three o'clock.
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I have no idea.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
What were the crows after at the school?
No one called it a war!
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
With smoke.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Not if they're starting a war.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
I want you to help my little girl.
Ask this one favor --
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
MacFarlane
I've heard of it.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
He was a nice horse.
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
I am the best man for the job.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
Get out of here!
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
Yes.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
No great lady will ever take my place?
I'll get him.
Where are they?
You're wrong.
Tell her... we'll get him.
Dream on.
Good thing in a situation like this.
How can you die if you're already dead?
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
So you're going to kill him?
My father.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
What did I say?
Just hold on to me.
No.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
About you.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
Yes.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Of course, dear.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
What do you mean, dear?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Yes, I have!
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
About 250 million of your miles.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Thank you... Have you any news?
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
You still haven't answered my question.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
Is that what you're thinking about?
Goodnight, my dear.
Yes--?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
It won't work.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
Who?
Remember those words.
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
Would you like to sell it?
I'd give you a very good price.
No -- I'm afraid not.
How long will that take?
Can't stand light?
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
El Vampiro.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
<u>Four</u> to go.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
Honda 250, huh?
Hey, take it easy.
No.  Stick around.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
Chill out Edgar.
You have a T.V.?
Lots more where he came from.
Who, Laddie?
No.  Just you.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
He's already gone to bed.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
What do you mean?
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
No... no, everything's different now...
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Okay.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Nowhere.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Piss off.
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
I don't know.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
Let's load 'em.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Anybody sick?
Finish what?
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Watch Clark.
Ain't it there?
Let go of me...
Hell no.
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
It's shorted out or something!
Look, I'm just guessing...
What for?
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
I guess I'm the only one.
Nothing we can do about that.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
When was the last time you used it?
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
What's that?
Well, stick to it.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Don't let up, Childs!
Damn if I won't.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
We going to make it?
Why?
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
The generator!
What for?
Hear what?
And everyone looks like us?
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
Where?
This is it?
1899.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Can you show us where they live?
Yes.
Last night.
This is the way in?
What do you mean?
No...
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
How?
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
No...
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
I just love mechanical things.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
What's happening to the moon?!
Got here as soon as I could.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Holding you... again.
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
What?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Oh?
Hiding?
I would.
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
Sir...?
Mm.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
Thank you...
Good night.
Thank you.
I can see Kalen's point.
Go back to your own time?
Exactly correct, sir.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
I did...
No...
Why?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
They've gone to a better place.
Kalen...
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
We never should have done this to him...
Depends on what you're seeing.
In where?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
How?
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
They should just be looking harder.
Sure.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
No, it hasn't.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
You two ok?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Jackie.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
Yeah.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I know.
I don't know.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
I guess I'd ask you why.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
I never knew my father. Did you?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You have nothing to fear, William.
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
What are you talking about?
The Jacket.
Why?
Where are you going?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Why "of course"?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
I'm sorry.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
What?
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You girls are in some hot water.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
It's him.
A .38.
Oh, definitely.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
What for?
Shut up.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Maybe.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Am I in trouble?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Isn't this fun?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
So this is all my fault, is it.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
What did Darryl say?
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Yeah.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Alright, Louise!
Let's get it over with.
Yeah.
I can see that.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Gosh.  It sure is.
We should have just ignored him.
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
Hit it.
Just asking.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
What?!
Why?
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
What are you talkin' about?
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
I'll try to be more careful.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
I guess.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Yeah, but he was successful.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Uh-huh.
Yeah feels like it.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Huh.
Who?
Call you back.
You got a brew?
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Am I?
Yep.
You own a home there?
I already know it, Mary.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
We will, but first I have a surprise.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Well, I'll see ya.
What?
Huh... that's strange.
Warren!
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Who the hell's Woogie?
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You don't buy what?
No.
So you found Mary?
Huh?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Good good.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
What do you mean 'why'?
Do what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kim and I are close friends!
You mean him.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Who?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
What do you mean?
And you met Mary how?
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
That must make it tough.
No I'm not.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
Puffy, get over here.
Where would I have seen your work?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Oh Jesus...
Thanks a lot, Ted.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Hi, Mary.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Just a minute.
Who's that?
Really? I never got a message.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Trying to be.
Yeah, sure.
Mary, come on...
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
I wish.
You got what stuck?
What?! No please, sir --
Oh God.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Kenny. It's over.
Time is of the essence.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Dean Rusk!
I, uh...
No you weren't.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I know, I know...
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Hey. Nice tie.
Rug samples.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
Again. Figures, man.
Sioux Indian, right?
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Seven.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
Ray.
Check him out, Ray.
Beats the hell outta me.
Go ahead.
Cooch. You're my hero.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
She's that subtle?
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
You've got no jurisdiction.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
He said he doesn't know.
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
He also said "listen to the water."
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
I don't see the connection.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
What are you talking about?
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
What do you mean?
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
I read, Cooch.
Ray. What's your 20?
I'm on my way back in. Over.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
It's classified.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Where were you?
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Um. You.
Too aggressive?
I'm special.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
What are you talking about?
Uh hum.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
I'm starting to sense that now.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
I was flying...my responsibility.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
That's three.
Who's gonna win?
How could you?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Yes sir!
YEAH, COUGAR?
What is?
Not anymore.
Okay, okay.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Yawing right.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Who's your pilot?
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Right.
Come on, relax...
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
LOOK OUT!
Just below ten thousand.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
Three guesses.
How's it goin', Coog?
Sir?
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Then why are you here?
All right.
What was that?  An accident?
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
And you get a kickback.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Thank you.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
So why am I still alive?
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
No, sir.
It's about goddamn time.
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Nice to meet you.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
C'mon!
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Harry!
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
What is it?
Up!
Nobody.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Just think about it.
All right, forget about it.
I'm late.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
I'm not your wife.
I'm honored.
Bullshit.
Mars.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Not any more.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
I used to model for 'em, why?
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
Oh, since when?
Aliens built it.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Some kind of mutation...?
Ready as we'll ever be.
No problem.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
My cannon.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
I think I scared it!
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
In a minute.
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Has a lot of rain.
Do not talk to the driver.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Why?
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
You got <u>that</u> right!
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Like hell you are.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Could be.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
True.
Absolutely.
It most certainly is.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
No further questions.
We had a description of the suspect.
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
Of course.
Chinatown street gang.
You really think that's what happened?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
-- You found his mugshot?
-- Yeah?
I feel much better now.
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Roger Baron.
But what?
That's why I hate experts.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Neither.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
That's right.
Exactly what happened then?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
About Chinatown. What went down.
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
It was self-defense.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
Badgering.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
-- Eddie told you?
-- What trial?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
For control of the prison drug trade?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Shu's the only one I know of...
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
I want you.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
What?
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Anything else?
And neither will I.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Ever see her with someone else?
Did she ever mention any friends?
What do you mean?
Shorthand. Really?
What do you mean?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
I don't know, Sam.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
It's late, Sam.
I'll get my kit.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
When?
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
Maybe.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Nothing.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
WE got it back, that's all.
Fill 'er up.
I haven't got it yet.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
Maybe.
I'm not.
I already made you two tapes.
Hey, Jacques...
Let's go all the way.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Not now.
I can't tonight.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
You know it and I know it.
You mean the ones you pity.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
What?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
What were you doing in my room?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Mom, take it easy.
Good night, sweetheart.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Yes.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
That's right.
Nothing, I chickened out.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
As far as we know, nothing.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
What does it mean?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Yes.
I...
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I'm just an M.D.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
You may step down.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Yes.
When she...
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
No, you did fine.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Yes. I wrote it.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Right. Who called?
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
How old is he?
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I'm sure you would.
That happens.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Overruled...
I think I will.
And are they going to get it?
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
What...?
Do you want me to go...?
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
From the magazine?
And ask me what?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
...I know. I went...
...fifty thousand dollars?
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Yeah.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
I can't talk now.
...one of the other nurses?
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I don't know.
Yes, that's correct.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
How'm I doing so far?
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
But I think I know where she'll be....
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
It was nearer than that.
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
Sort of a trial balloon.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
Yes, but...
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Absolutely.
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Finish, please!
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Your bed?
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Coming for you...
Here.
I'm fine.
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Yeah, sure.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Not yet.
Yep.
He knows.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
I can take it.
I haven't forgotten.
Yes, Sir.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
Okay.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
That's what they get for not locking the door.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
What?
No, I didn't.
Me too.
Yes.
I know you will.
Maybe it's an air raid.
I can't watch this.
Fine.
Forget it.
Do what?
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
My dad.
Who?
Sir...?
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Twice.
It has nothing to do with him.
You do?
Yes sir.
You're officer of the watch, George.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
What's that?
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
Why would you do that?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Shut up donut.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
I don't have to listen to this.
You know what he is talking about here?
What is it... the secret?
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
About anything.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
I'm not staying out here.
Aaauuuhhh!!!
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
What makes you so sure it was one?
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
It wasn't hard.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Why? He's right in the groove.
How old are you?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
You was in the Marines, huh?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
No, haven't heard of it.
Sorry to hear it.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Have now.
Forty bucks...
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
That's right... Take one of these.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
What's the name of it?
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
...Asshole.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
See ya downstairs.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Didn't he say somethin'?
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
What's that?
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
What'd you say to her?
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
You do.
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Under a hundred.
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
One bad car accident...
Uh-huh?
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
What if I asked you not to?
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Yes.
Yes... Get rid of him.
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
No... But...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Thanks...
How are you, Crabtree?
She's still a transvestite.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
I thought you were tinkering.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Because... because...
What's to tell?
So what's the problem?
No wonder he screwed us over.
Call it a hunch.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
You did.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
You're in Kinship?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
It's colder in there.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
You're welcome.
Who?
What'd you tell him?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Hm.
So where have you been staying?
Hm.
What kind of dancer?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
I eat.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
That good, huh?
Chancellor.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
She's left before...
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
James Leer.
I said it didn't sound like you.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Dozens. It's very sad.
Oh?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
This is important.
I'm in love with your wife.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Sick.
Taking the long way home.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
The perpetrator.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
I doubt it, darling.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
It's a nice table.
It was a beautiful present.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
When?
I mean... feelings.
Sure.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Not yet.
I have no idea.
Got something to hide?
Who said I wanted to buy it?
They grow outside, don't they?
Yes.
Know what?
I went to bed around seven.
Yes.
It gives me headaches.
Yeah.
No you're not.
How come?
It sounds like you were banished.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
What will happen if I do?
I don't mind.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Ev-i-dence.
You think reflection is good.
How's that?
No fucking way.
It's okay.
I don't feel anything.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
I'm afraid not.
They usually tell me.
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
I said I was sorry.
You mean my problem?
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Not so fast.
In my bedroom, sleeping.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
Nothing.
This is garbage!
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
Accept you?
I'll buy a plant.
What about them?
What?
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
Twelve years in prison?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
Who doesn't?
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
I'm not scared.
Do you want to talk about it?
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Where're you?
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Your rig?
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
That must be it.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
They'll come out after us.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
I don't know, look around.
Calm down, Bud.
We've only got one suit.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
God, I hate that bitch.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Yuh?
You watch yourself.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
How deep?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
What's the timer set for?
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
That seems to apply to you also...
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
No.
And why do you tell us this only now?
It takes even less.
Who knows why they all left...
Are you joking?
What! Get married?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
Nothing.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
To do what?
You say that just to flatter me.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
Ask her.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
What boat?
They didn't seem too good.
Lady Patrizia!
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
You're kidding!
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Why?
Who tells you these things?
That's not what he meant.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
I burnt them.
Yes.
Anything... may I sit down?
Love.
I love you.
Oh, there are so many.
And then what?
In the middle of all the pain?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Would you like to ask them?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything.
Does it bother you?
What?
I don't know.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
You'll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
I was a mistake.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
She can.
She watches... she listens.
Yes.
Her headaches.
Alright.
Yes.
Because I'm in trouble.
It came out of me.
Yes.
Yes.
Are you ill?
No... don't hit me please...
Who?
How did she know about him?
Where?
Agnes, who did this to you?
Yes.
What?
Sister...
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
If I find anything I'll call you.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
How do you survive?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
... Thank you.
Yes.
Yes, but I...
Obviously there was.
What's your opinion?
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
About two years before.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
What?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Oh, some time in January.
Earthquakes?
What is it?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
I knew that after the fact.
Nothing...
Long, thin and filtered.
Would it stop you if I did?
Who is he?
My God, you're as crazy as...
This is insane.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
I'm concerned about her health.
Is it because she's a nun?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Wasn't it!
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Eh?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
You do - repeatedly.
Have I said something amiss?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
We do.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Sorry.
He comes from a large family.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
Come here.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm not ...
The big hammer?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Out where?
What's that mean?
Yeah ... that's right.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Eh?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
Don't dramatise.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
For Ringo.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
What little old man?
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Hello.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Well ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Shurrup, cheerful.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
... I don't know...
Dell, plot our location.
What's the terrain down there?
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Hard to say.
Yeah!
Shit...
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
The water will still recycle.
Right.
No, I don't want us separated.
Right. 
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
I'll come with you.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Still unconscious?
Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
Sounds like a rough one.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
Is it still dripping?
We're going into the freezers now.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
Look --
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Close...
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Anything else?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Oh well... you know me.
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
I guess we open the door and net it.
By eating our food supplies.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Kablooey.
What can I do?
Sure.
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Thanks.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Shit.  When?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Has anybody talked to them?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Okay.
What's the problem?
What is that?
Well... try the headset.
Is that a fact.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Check out the tent.
Agreed.
What can I do?
No!
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Give me a yell is something happens.
I call myself Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
That's right.
Yes. The Shubert.
Eddie...
I believe I will.
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
I'm in love with Lloyd!
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
What of it?
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
As of this moment you're six years old...
I love you...
What?
She's a girl of so many interests.
Twenty minutes!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
What a body, what a voice.
Now don't get carried away-
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
What would you like? Texas?
You know what I'm going to be?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
I just asked a simple question.
You didn't have to tell me.
Of course not.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
When I told you what every young actress should know.
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
How did you get in here?
I might.
I don't care if I never get home.
You rest. I'll get it...
Oh, no. I see the play.
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
My husband...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Hollywood.
Of course.
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
I don't intend to be.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
- an understudy's performance.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Of course it is.
There are other plays...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
I had no idea you knew each other.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Isn't that what they always say?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
About what?
I just can't believe it.
With tears.
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
What is?
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
That was a pity...
I'm trying hard to follow you.
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
They'd die without each other.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Where is she?
I will.
How do you mean?
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
All you got to do is name it.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--mine's better--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Yeah?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Hmm.
--fifteen phone calls--
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
And I'm a Republican.
You voted for him.
Go on, go on--
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--shit--
--has he got an ax?--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
If he self-destructed.
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
Goddamnit!--
Whatever.
This?  Naw...
Chapin did contact you then?
On the orders of Haldeman?
And?--
--Deep Throat?--
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
Just let me get a match.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
--this'll only take one second--
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
...you're definitely doing a story...?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
To where?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
--yes, yes, what is it?
Security consultant.
--I'm Woodward.
I think so.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
Lotsa hints--
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
Absolutely.
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
Sorry.
Sorry, coach.
Like what?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Seduce her.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Why is this?
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Because I want to.
You talked to Stifler?
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
That's nice.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
What?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
You can't sing at the competition.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
Yeah right.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Yeah, that's right.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Nothing!
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Okay!
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Okay.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
You think so?
Okay, don't stop.
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Just a second!
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Okay.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Ready for what?
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Fuck yeah we will.
Shut the fuck up.
Uh huh.
No way.
Uhh! Would you die already!
But you better hurry.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
No it isn't! You're dead!
What?
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Andy...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Why the fuck would I do that?
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Yes sir.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
How to read.
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then come find me.
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Yes, your highness.
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I was all out of dynamite!
Why?
Now just get off the train.
No!
Sad?
Don't be
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
You'd lose your security deposit?
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Ah! Let us begin!
Rasputin!
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
M'mm.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Alvy.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Wisconsin.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Okay.
Nice car.
Yeah, I know.
Well...
Okay.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
It's terrific.
Really?
Yeah.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
M'hm.
M'hm.
U-huh.
M'hm.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
Oh, yeah.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Well, have you ever made love high?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Let's just do it, all right?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
I didn't follow you!
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Following is different. I was spying.
Yeah?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
There's a spider in the bathroom.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Oh. What?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
I don't know.
Holy cow!
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
What... huh?
Oh! My God! 
Thing?
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Remember that day?
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
My head is throbbing.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Tell him.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Whatta you mean?
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Oh, Jesus.
M'hm.
And... uh-
You think so? Do you really?
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
I don't know. I don't know.
I was very charming.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
And how's the diva doing?
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
October-ish.
Not this time.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
You want a Tylenol, or something?
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Yeah.
Damn straight.
Sally?
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
She's in ICU.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Nice to meet you.
Let me heal you, baby.
Hey!  Would you?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Probably not.
Fantastic.  Out here.
I love you, you're a genius.
He's directing now.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel.
Happy anniversary.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
He'll find his way back.
Otis!!!!
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
That is not true.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't do this.
I guess.
Will you make love with me?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
You're an interior decorator, right?
Elitism?
And you know, he really does not.
We're way past inappropriate.
I will treasure this.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
I think he's really angry with me too.
A lot of cakes.
You must have been a baby.
Come here.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Trust him.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Are you working on a new book?
Not at all.
Oh?
Thank you.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Like your business managers?
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Yes.  Fine.
Rose.
I thought it was okay where it was.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
You weren't exactly horrified.
Right...because every ant's important!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Yes.
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Want a list?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Well...no, but --
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
There's something going on, Z --
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
A <u>few</u>?
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Mom!
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Don't get all sappy about it!
Duty calls!
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Oh, of course --
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
You're a real buddy.
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
You shouldn't.
Much better.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
I don't understand --
You don't want me here --
Someone from the office.
I mean -- her apartment.
As soon as I can walk.
They had to pump it out.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Pick a card.
A cemetery?
Gin.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Pick up your cards and let's go.
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
Sure.
Who'd care?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
I guess so.
Cheers.
The dishes?
Fine. How's your eye?
I'm fine.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
What for?
I don't know.
What kind of joint are you running?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Now what was your news, Baxter?
I got kicked in the head, too.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
So what's it going to be?
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
No!
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
I have a vague idea.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
How many pills were in that bottle?
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Aren't you?
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Happy New Year.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
The party's over.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
No.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
I love you -- remember?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
The nerve.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Dreadful.
My men --
Get out --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Fat. That's real fat.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
Yeah, it is.
God knows.
Not a thing.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Who knows what's up there?
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
When'd you do it?
Looks pretty shallow.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Charlie?
This gentleman or myself ?
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
Do you know that jungle?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Wh -- what?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Haiphong.
No. Walked.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Yes, I know.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
What Truth?
Fuck no.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
When?
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
Sure.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
What things?
I know.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Right now -- I am.
Beverly Hills --
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
Needs patching.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
134  CONTINUED:  
I'll get you there all right.
94   CONTINUED:  
I just want this over with.
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
168  CONTINUED:
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
28   CONTINUED:
Back against the bars.  Now.
-- Corbett's a killer.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
New to the country, kid?
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
I'm right behind you.
You don't feel cold?
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
You don't know how true that is.
You broke the radio, remember?
You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Sure.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
What does this matter to you?
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
I'm a waitress.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
His home number.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Will you please take it?
I've got Jews at my table.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
No.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
No!!! Stay away from me!
Carol the waitress?
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Thank you.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
No.
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
This one has a special meaning.
Yeah... Well...
I can trust my brain.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Okay.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Two years ago...
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Do it.
What?
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Ask him.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
'Love was... '
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Get out.
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, sweetheart...
Never a break. Never.
Another place where?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
What's it mean?
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
You're right.  Talking too much again.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
How long have you been freelance?
I know you're going to jump.
I ain't scared of you.
That's right.
Know what?
I know.  It was a joke.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
Another contractor.
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Yes.
Right.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
Just Electra?
The C.I.A.?
Jesus -- why?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
Why?
They tried to kill you?
Because I want to know.
After that?
Nothing.
No.
Sorry.
Check.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
For Nicholai?
Yes.
Thank you.
And you were drilling these holes...?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Did he explain how this happened?
Why?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Okay.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Go ahead.
Anything.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
American currency.
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
So?
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
I thought that was part of the charm!
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
Is it gone four-thirty?
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
When your ready Son!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
No beer?
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
She's cool.
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
He got that one right.
So?
Here!
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
No!
Regards to Her Majesty.
Yeah, maybe.
How about you Brutus?
No way Doug, I can't.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
Can we charge admission?
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
How?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Yeah, but it was okay.
Alright!
Cool!
No!
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
You may use my office.
Yeah!
Working....Under cover.
Go to hell!
You bastard!
Very well.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
No. I won't be long.
Yeah.
I could take after Dad, too.
I meant he's a doctor.
I'm just wondering --
You do --
Later.
Me.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Kinda. Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
That is my telescope.
The dirty snowball at its core.
In ten words or less?
You don't believe in anything?
You don't miss a thing.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
What?
Why not?
No.
Fun.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
You're sometimes not sure?
Twice a year.
Where?
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
No.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Yes.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
It was a play.
I have expectations, too.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
That won't be possible.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Like what, sir?
Either. Both.
Praying.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
I'm no dummy.
I want to come back.
Please.
I'd work backstage or something?
When do I get time for me?
What do you want, Biff?
What do you want, Biff?
Uh, yes, sir...
Marty. What's for breakfast?
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Fine.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Seventeen.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
You do?
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Why?
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
What year?
Home, school, here... 
Yeah,  Right.
Pro! Release the rope!
Oh, right, right... 
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
Why?
Is Shemp all right?
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
You know me?
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
You were ringing the doorbell!
What if you lost your keys?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
You did what?!?
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
I run this place! 
What's going on?
Okay.
Okay.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Thirty aught six.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
What're you doing?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
He'll say that?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Great.
Spanish.
Okay.
How bad off is he?
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Just looking.
I don't want a steak.
Positive?
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
I'm serious.
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
No.
Just gimme a chance.
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
It's too dangerous.
I have a radio fix...
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Why me?
How about you? Will you be alright?
...I know this must look... funny.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
I want to know!
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
A week, eight, nine days –
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
And what would that be, son?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
Are you all right?
He's a great writer –
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
To see pap.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
That's all right, really, thank you.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
And I could tell you some stories –
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
Seen a doctor?
Nope.
...Yeah, okay.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
You gotta believe me –
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
Yeah.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
Congratulations.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Nine days – Tuesday –
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Anyway.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
...Fred...
How's about it, Bart?
Mr. Lipnik, please –
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Yeah.
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
Did you find out about her parents?
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
Bring 1976 up.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
I don't need any help.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
Put your hands up!
What?
Yes.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
Are you arresting me?
I don't smoke.
It won't last.
Why not?
I'd like to ask you some, too.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Do you?
You can make a mistake.
Fine.
What if I call you Nicky?
To see if he can get away with it.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
Fine.  How's your back?
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I know.
Make love to me.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
Try me.
I don't know.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Did you miss me?
Come over here and tell me no.
Really.  What are you writing about.
How did it end?
No.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Why would I need an attorney?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Cocaine.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
I hope I helped you out.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
What is it you got between you?
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
I know what that's like.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
You're my friend, Gus.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
What do you want?
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
She killed him.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Did you check all four years?
Really. Huh. Too bad.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Ignorant art?
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
We can do better. It needed more white.
Annina Nosei.
Aren't they?
You haven't been by lately.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Sure.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
I'm here.
What?
Out?
Yeah..
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
So then what?
Hi Gina.
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
I ain't John Henry.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
Can I walk you home?
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
You don't have any fucking money..
It's Monday morning.
Basquiat, what did you take?
Well thanks!
Hi.
How is he?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Thanks
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
I didn't know.
I just don't think you're being fair.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Have we?
No darker than yours, Bruce.
"We"?  You and...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Your blood, Max.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Yes?
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Pheromones?
Hey, what's your problem?
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Surf's up.
He'll be here.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
I can make it.
Can he save her?
Just the beast.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
What?
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
I knew you could handle it.
You lie!
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
I've got to stop him.
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why, indeed?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Big house. How many rooms?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
Would you? I'm not so sure.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Well, I met someone...
And now....
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What are you talking about?
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
Well -- I think you might consider
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
What is it you want?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
What are you talking about?
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
That's it.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
What were you thinking?
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Yeah. Deja vu.
Great. How??
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
David, I'm serious!
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Thanks, Annie.
Uh ... yes ...
Excuse me.
Ahm.... .
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Yes, isn't he.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Ahm....
Certainly is.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
And a car.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
How the hell should I know?
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Nope.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
What?
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Yeah, we should party.
Me first?
Me first! Me first!
Me first!
Yeah, really.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Huh? Huh huh.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Uh... dill, um, face...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Cut the power!
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
That's better. Yes?
Where did these guys come from?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Agent Hurley...
Not now Bork.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Yup. Huh huh.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
No, Jane.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
They make gypsies look good.
<u>You</u> left me.
Not really...  what's this?
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Wait.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
Of course I did.
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
Just a hunch.
We're ghosts.
Is this like a trick question?
We tried.
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Where'd they go?
I... I don't know what your name is.
No, dummy.  Two.
Just <u>say</u> it.
... I will.

It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Why not?
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
I'm lonely.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
I'm sorry already.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Viridian?
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
The attic.
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
Their wedding clothes.
But not for long...
Yes. I think so, too.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
I like to watch. This is fine.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Hello, Eve.
No, thank you.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Hello, Morton.
I see.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes. You look very sick.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
I understand.
Thank you, Ben.
Yes. I would like to do that.
I like to watch.
Yes.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Oh. Thank you.
Yes. Of men and women.
... Yes. You can take me.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Yes. It is.
Yes.
Which view?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
No.
I was given meals, and a home...
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
But you won't sign, correct?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Yes, I will.
I said - try again.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Do you need a secretary?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Good evening, Wilson.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
It's not that, I just...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Look, Johanna...
Right, Chief.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Malkovich!
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
May 11th.
I'm a puppeteer.
I... puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Hmmm.
The ferret?
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
No they're not.
Yes.
Me and John.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
What's that?
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
That... was... no... simulation.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Schwartz.
My name is Schwartz.
I am a trained performer.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
You married?
It better be.
What's he been in?
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Do you?
Count me in.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No, I didn't know that.
No.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I love you, Lotte.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
No.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
You mean with Malkovich?
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
That's the last thing they took from me.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
YES.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
Yes?
Yes sir
I will.
Oh.
Yes ma'am.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Oh I been out.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Might see anything at all at 124.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
You was friends.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
That's so.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
I don't believe that. I won't.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Why me, man?
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The?  Who the fff--
Yeah, it sucks.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
Nothing.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
We have the urn.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
And this guy peed on it.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Thank you, Donny.
Huh?
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Uh-huh.
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Different mothers, huh?
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
And what do you do, sir?
What's your drink, Dude?
On you, maybe.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Well--yeah, I guess--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Uh-huh.
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Okay. That, uh.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Huh?
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Yeah.
What if it's during a game?
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Walter, please--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
But Walter--
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Dude--
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
The bulk of the series.
Look, man, did you--
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Yeah?
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah.
No Dude.
Then what's...
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Dude, I'm sorry--
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
I don't know, sir.
Help me put him back in his chair.
I said out.  Now.
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Survival.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Minutes.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I don't understand.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
So?
Too bad you're out of it.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
How can you be out here?
You're wrong.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
Who is LaMagra?
"The Blood Tide".
How do I stop it?
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
For them. But for me --
I was afraid that might happen.
Then what is it?
No problem.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
You've been listening in the whole time?
We weren't sure we could trust you.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
He killed them?
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
--which she may have--
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
The Witch's voice.
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
You feel no need to get married or anything.
I want to see the tapes.
--bullshit!
What?
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
Both. Now.
Turn the tapes back on.
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
Butt-ugly owl.
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Don't have one.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
Down there in the Park.
How's she going to know where to--
--I don't know.
No one ever comes here.
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
Anna's the witch.
What?
I am.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
Ah, Domini?
--no.
Then I have no idea.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Yeah.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
I don't....
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
No, I--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
I just gotta see a guy.
I couldn't believe it either...
Abby... you all right?
Yeah.
...What was that?
In the trunk.
With your gun?...
Remy.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
Ever durned one.
What?
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
So it would seem.
Of course.
How would I know?
Right.
For what?
Tuesday.
What?
Okay honey.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
. mommy's here.
Jeffrey.
I wanted to see you.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I'll go then.
It's okay. It's okay.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
What?
Then don't talk about killing.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
No.
Don?. Are you in with them?
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Beeeee careful.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
Sometimes I think I do.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
What?
Yes.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
I'm here, aren't I?
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
You want to go talk to him?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey?. Why?
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Go ahead.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
I'll get a coat for her.
What?
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
What is?
What is?
You happy, baby?
Are you kidding?
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
No.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Oh hey, one more thing?
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Because they caught me?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
Okay.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
We're half a million off.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
You fucked me, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Oh, I see.
Mom.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
Actually, it was three.
It's beautiful.
Family.
And Diego?
Yeah.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Not mad.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Dad.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I'll tell her.
That was a beautiful message.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
She did that before.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.
Kristina's fine.
What's happening to us?
Dad.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
I'll be here.
I don't believe you.
Swear on my life.
Shhhh.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
Don't be such a pussy.
The strike is a success; but ...
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
And here?
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Here?
It's a question of habit ...
I think it'll be a success ...
Why?
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
Good evening, sir.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Cause?
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Like cats and dogs.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Sex.
Sit down, Frank.
Aren't they all?
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
I have.
No.
I assume his girlfriend.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Yes.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
She didn't.  She just left.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
I was angry.
That's enough.
No.
No.
No.
Yes.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
What changed?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Because he called me.
You know I can't talk about that.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
It won't be that hard.
Yeah.
What would?
You take a lot for granted.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
I went out on the boat.
Are you scared?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
That wasn't the deal.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
Why?
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
How often do you use cocaine?
Yes.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
We have to talk.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
No -- never.
Why are there two deeds here?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Heat is heat.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
That's it.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Not at all.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
We got engaged.
Yes.
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Wonderful. Uh...
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Yeah. See you later.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Yes, that'd be nice.
Why?
I had a temper.
What?
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
No one's asking you to!
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
For who?
Then he can move! People move!
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Cremated?!
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Then what do you care?
Yeah?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Just some flies.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Wh-wh-whooo?
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Just try it.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
What?
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Then fuck it!!!
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
I manage them.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
You were just a kid.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
Shit, that was fast.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
It was just like in my head.
That building?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
No!  They're still on their way.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
You don't, you can't believe that ...
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Just hurry.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
You betrayed me!
I'm listening.
Sure, Gino, sure.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
It's all right, sir.
Oh, right.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
No.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
How do I know you are cops?
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
I knew it.
Not exactly.
...  yes.
You have to ask?
Almost five years.
I guess I wanted to.
I'm not afraid of anything.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Is that what her daddy tells her?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Even though he knew about you?
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Mickey?
How much money?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
Is that what you think?
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
...  shit.
Yeah.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
He does it right in front of him.
An accident.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
Violet?
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
Right.
-- sir? --
Yes, I'm here...
Yes.
Really.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
What?  Like amnesia?
No.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
That's it?  Is that it?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
I guess.
...omigod, no...
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- there's no time --
-- how? --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
We have to keep moving.
I can't protect you anymore.
Think I could rent a scooter?
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
My husband's out looking for him.
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
I'm sorry.
Enhance it.
Abbott wants to talk.
<u>Where am I</u>?
I won't forget this.
... get to it.
You don't have to sing it.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Layton.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
No, no ... I did that...
Even later.
Really? - God, how time flies!
Er, I knew you looked different.
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Ah ...
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
Not much.
I'm sure you have
What has Tuttle done?
Yes. I'm impressed.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
You're the only person I can trust.
We don't make mistakes.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Shut up!
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Oh.
It's you ... it's you ...
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Cut it out, Sam.
Stop it ... damn you!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
"And your children all gone."
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Go away.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Yes.
Your face ... are you hurt?
Where are you going?
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Sam Lowry.
Yes.
This is your dream girl, is it?
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
You haven't switched it on.
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
I'm sorry but ...
You're not listening, mother.
This isn't rare!
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Er, yes ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you for calling Cen -
Hello. Mr Lowry?
What? Who is this?
Fixed?
Are you saying this is illegal?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
No. Wait here.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
He looks like a cop.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
You're going to live.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
No, I'd better not.
Oh man, Bucky.
John, play the Sinatra.
His heart's beating.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
He's working a double shift.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Okay.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
You asked me not to come.
No, no.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Yes.
It's early for him.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Frank!
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
What?
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
One more time!
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You've made my dreams silly.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Why do you say that?
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Not because you have to.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
I didn't know you were going with him.
Okay, great -- good luck.
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
People phoned in.
I'm not kidding.
Sit down, stop.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Speaking.
Your hair's a little funny.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Stop it.
Outside?
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
I'll speak to you soon
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
It's started.
We could...
Should I...
No stop where he's all besieged.
Follow me.
Bad manners.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
They fired me.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Yes.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Then you should stay here.
A picnic?
Right back to you.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
What, right now?
Shh!
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Honest?
Better!
Yes Walter.
Forget it.
What?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Do you have to be so cold to him?
What are you doing here so early?
Nothing...nothing at all.
I admit it.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Not only that, he copied us!
I know, man.
Yeah, right outside the door!
Well it sure looks dead enough.
I don't have another cat!
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Yeah?
Excuse me I have to make a call...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
No...look I'm busy...
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Good morning Walter!
What do you get?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
T-turned on?
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Then let me give you something then...
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
I had him in my grasp.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Would you sleep with them?
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Let me in.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Uum... around ten?
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
Hi.
You weren't home.  Like always.
It could happen.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Water.  Okay.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Yeah?
I know.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
I'm going to the senior dance.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Why don't we see a movie?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I forgot.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
She --
All right.
Our purposes.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Fine.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Don't start with me again.
I...
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
I can't work this.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Thanks.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
I don't understand.
Jeffrey!
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Like we don't have rights too?
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
You can learn to like it.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
What?
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Switch nostrils?
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Nuke?!
Get over here.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I'm trying to play with your body!
it's okay..
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
He's a virgin.
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
We all deserve to wear white.
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
What do you believe in?
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
He won't make love to me anymore.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
You okay?
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Who?
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
What's it say?
He'll learn.
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
I thought I was--
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
How?
Gimme that.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
Naw...
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Jesus.
C ' mon!
Forget it.
You too...Meat.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
Love to--
Pussy.
Can I give you my testimony?
We're getting married.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
What are you talking about?
Was I at that dinner?
Philip, if you would rise.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Excuse me.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Hold on a second.
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
Lester...
Right away.
Okay.
Matter of fact...
Hey.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
No.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
In so many words, yes.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
I don't wanna come along with you.
I'll be honest with you.
Yeah.
...to me.
Why?
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Well...
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
How do you do?
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
I'll come by.
Good to meet you.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
It's nice isn't it?
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
But as much as they loved her...
Yeah.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
No.
You can trust me.
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
I gotta tell ya...
What's it...
Mm-hm.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
And where'd you go?
What did Jennifer have?
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Listen to me.
You fuckin' whore!
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I wouldn't do that...
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
That's amazing.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Can you do it with your left hand?
God! 
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Mm.
Mm.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Well, I've been busy. 
I can't.
Pitch-black?! It -
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Calm down! Calm down!
But I'm just trying to leave.
What're you gonna do?
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Hm.
He's good. He's fine.
That's enough now!
Mm.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
Oh, come on.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
Yeah?
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yes, you are.
It's what you want?
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
Okay, yeah.
Thank you. Very nice.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Get lost?
Get lost?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
You are.
No, Lester.
Promise?
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
Lester - he called you here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
All right.
You know why, right?
You jag-off.
She asleep?
Stacy. 
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
So are we.
Go fuck yourself.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Get out. Get out! Get out!
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Mr. Chairman -
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
Then do it the way you want.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
This looks promising...
Guilty. I am.
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
It may be time to get the police involved...
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
You've seen me...
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
I actually got some memory back last night.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
Uh-huh..
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
But I'm blind.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
You going to talk all day?
Where do you think you're going?
Don't you have children?
You could've made me lose my call.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
You could've killed us.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
Or relieve me of it later.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
It's taken care of.
Bullshit.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Make a "U" and go back.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
What am I supposed to do?
Allow me.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
You don't understand.
Will you let me explain!
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
I realize you don't want to be involved.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
What about the others?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
That's not her.
The City National on San Vincente.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
Your husband?
You're all three of you in that van?
Shit.  I'm sorry.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Hand me the phone.
There isn't any such person.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
I thought it was inspired.
You knew about me.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Stop talking like that!
259-7881.
Ask them.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
That's not good enough.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Took preparation.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
Who is this?
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
I wish it had never been invented.
Just relax.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Don't worry.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
In your dreams.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Is that good or bad?
Thanks.
See what, Dil?
Did he?
What would you call it?
Hi, Jimmy.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Cunt.
Charming.
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
What?
In a way.
The accent, I suppose.
Must be.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
No, I didn't --
Where?
What look?
They're jealous.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
How different?
Tell me about him.
Did you do that to him?
Didn't think I could.
I am.
He did sometimes.
Depends what it is.
I'm thinking of your man.
No...
What you doing here?
You mean that?
Shut up.
You think that's wise?
When?
Sorry.
Not at all, honey.
You following me?
Yes.
No.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
What?
No! I'm going home...
In a manner of speaking.
Got to be somewhere.
More what?
I like you, DIl
Do I?
Please, Dil --
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
He's all right.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
My pleasure.
He's hot.
I know.
No, what is the thing?
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
I take pride in my work.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Peter.
Would make me feel better about it.
Yeah.
My pleasure.
What is it now?
Do what?
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
She's not my type.
No.
What?
Suppose you could say that.
Why did you sign up?
Ever see hurling?
Best game in the world.
The fastest.
Shut up, would you?
Doesn't matter where.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Some kinds of women are...
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
A story.
What does that mean?
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
What you say, faster?
Tell me, Jody
Nice lady.
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
You're crazy --
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
How was I leading you on?
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
You're going to look for him -- now?
Open up.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
I love you, Adam.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
No!
You lied to me so many times --
No thanks.
Agent.
May I have a sandwich, please?
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Who?
Describe him.
Barely, yes.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
But no one actually saw him die.
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Very good.
Next, please.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Me?
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Reggie -- listen to me --
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
No.
Maybe.
Why?
I'm scared.
Shut the door!
I don't believe it.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Fiction or non-fiction?
Go on.
You mean, you're a thief?
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
In money.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
Not unless we're blind.
What do you want?
Leave me alone -- !
Stop it!
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
I'm very cold.
He didn't have one.
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
What should we give him?
Up there! I would put it up there!
I found it! I found it!
No, Jean-Louis.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Why, do you think we're going to?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
Having a nervous breakdown.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
How about once more around the park?
How would you like a spanking?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Be careful, Peter.
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Words can hurt very much.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Wha -- what do you want?
Don't you want me to stay?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
The American Embassy.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
It won't happen again.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
You never went, uh, all the way?
Are you sure?
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
No?
Are you sure?
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
She works at a church?
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
What?
I'm sure you should have failed.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Who?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
Stag?
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
That's not why we broke up.
This party is sick.
You can ask me anything.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
And she didn't?
No, you keep one.
Ok.
Told you to hide it.
But you don't really mean it.
If sheep don't count.

Oh...

Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Except for the fact that I need cash.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
 No.
...ya?
I need your help.
You want cash?
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I need your truck!

I'm gonna stomp your a--
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Are you kiddin'?
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
I ain't playin' that.
You're nuts, goin' back there!


Oh...
...you.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
...truck!
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--

  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...we can make it.
Oh, shit.
Goddamn!
I know the likeli-...
Come on, old...
...you crazy bastard.
Hey!
 Shit. 

Okay.

Okay.  Okay.
Oh, no!

This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
You're fucked, man.
You know what I'm sayin'?
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
We got two paddles.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
Hey.   Mason.
...or my conscience.


We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Reach into my pocket.
 Come on!
 Okay.
  I've got the real thing!
...our ass!
Tunnel.
 What's it say? 




Who drove the ice cream...
Yeah.
 big balls.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Well, well, well.
Three seconds.  One...
Hey!
So...where's my truck?
Mason, you have to take this...
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
  Hey, actually...
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.

Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
Let's proceed.
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
Went away? 
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
Forget about him.
Pleasant surprise.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...

And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
How much longer for the range and power projections?

Jake, for Christ's sake.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
His girlfriend?
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
What is it?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Oh, my, yes.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
I think I'll kill her.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Where's that?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Jake, listen.
I've been wanting to meet you.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
How'd you get past the guards?
Since when?
I don't.
Yeah?
I heard it was an accident.
Too late for what?
Matter of fact I do.
I guess not.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
I said I'll drop it.
I don't want to drop it.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
...Just a minute...
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
He told you?
You mean you don't know where you were?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
No.
They can't be.
Get in the car.
I gave everybody the night off.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
He owns it. You know?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
I am not!
Sure.
Where's the girl?
I want to see her.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
...no...
Where can we go?
He didn't wear bifocals.
I'm all right.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
I think I got something.
You'll find one of those people.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Oh, good.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
I'm sorry, I --
Help yourself.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Well, no.
Never.
What about the water?
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Yeah.
Mr. Gittes...
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
He was expecting you?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He owned it.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
But that's what you told your wife.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She ran away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
But you don't have any kids!!!
Then why don't you change jobs? 
No...
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
Come in, Alfredo.
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
So what's that got to do with it?
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
Where is he?
Thais.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
You don't really think so?
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Who said anything about brooms?
That looks pretty nice.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
We've got a nice plant here.
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Emily -
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
It can wait.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Thanks.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
Oh, me -
I work at Seligman's.
Well, I -
Oh, no, that's all gone.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
You can't stop me.
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
All right.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
Charlie -
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
Are you finished?
I know you will.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
That's the train with all the lights.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Was he in love?
Sure.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Queer?
What did you get?
What about that apartment?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Am I sure about what?
Are you serious?
You're shittin' me.
He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
I feel nauseous.
No, don't!
Dante. You've got a customer.
I can't believe you're here.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
Very dramatic, I thought.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
And you said yes?
But you were.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Let me take you out tonight.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Oh God...
In a second!
Lenin's Tomb.
Annoying Customer.
What's your point?
Oooh! Navy Seals!
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Shocking abuse of authority.
Why?
You called Caitlin again?
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Your mother.
You think things would be any different now?
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
There's more?
Yeah.
Basically.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
Can we talk about this later?
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Why not?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
FUCK!
I know.
I'm going to miss the game.
You've got a customer.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Yeah, right.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
That's embarrassing?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Yeah, but at what a price.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Exactly.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
Five hundred dollars.
I don't; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Because I'm here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
I'm happy.
I'm not.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I'll read the book.
Could be.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
What time did we go to the funeral?
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
What are you talking about?
What responsibility?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Helluva day.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Yes.
I'm her sister.
Excuse me?
They are not.
How much can you bench?
Yeah?
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
Nothing personal.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She's my girlfriend.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
So I'm told.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
I hate this fucking place.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
She called you, didn't she?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
Including you?
Three including you.
I'm not the pig you are.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Why do you say that?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Dante...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for the lasagne.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Sure.
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
I don't want Caitlin...
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Can I have your name please?
WHAT?
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
That's tight. Solid.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
No, I wasn't.
You'll be missed.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
He didn't ask me to...
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
What?
That woulda been cool.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
There wasn't time for anything else.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
Not on that leg.
One...
You couldn't.
From one professional to another, of course.
He doesn't want my help.
What are you doing here!?
How'd you get up here?
Excuse me?
What about you?
Call me sentimental.
Of course I do.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Get it!
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
Don't let me fall!
I don't know.  I don't know.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
I won't do it.  No way.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
We can't and he knows it.
Good morning, Walt.
Richard Travers.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
You bastards... bastards.
I've been cured.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
You wanna be sick?
Murder, sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
How're you feeling this morning?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Vitamins will it be then?
You mean like going to the pictures?
Fine. Fine.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
You're kidding me.
Oh, my, yes.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
I'm sorry.
Very generous.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
I don't know...
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
Try?
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
What happens if you don't?
Who is this?
Twenty-four minutes.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
You mean like benefits?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Yeah.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
I'm trying...
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
I think so.
South Central.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Believe it.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I listen to classical.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
No.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
Don't start.
What happened?
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
No.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
You had to kill Heller?!
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
What's at Union Station?
One more.
What'd they do?
That's the reason?
Answer the question.
Slow down.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Excuse me?
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Drop me off here!
Mississippi?
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Motive?
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
For what?
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I think so.
Do they have a secret handshake?
I have no idea.
Surprise me.
Pretty scary, huh?
Never heard of him.
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
How is it possible?
Right here in Manhattan.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Thanks.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Where were you the day he died?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
You do?
They'll trace it.
You saw me standing alone ...
Where are you?
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
Well, I don't know if --
A dog bit it.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
Only on the football field.
We're very specialized.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
Terminal?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
You do recognize it then?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Working.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
And Jonas?
Where do you think Jerry is?
What?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Tell me.
So?
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
No doubt.
What?  Why?
Ellie.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
This... seemed best.
Good luck, David.
What would you have me say, David?
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Well --
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
No primer.
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Because I can't.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
Okay.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Many others.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
That's my girl...  Lights.
A page-break signal.  A period.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
Any luck on the grant money?
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
It's really happening.
How long was I gone?
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
Some of my best friends are scientists.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
You're willing to die for this.
What'd you think?
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
But --
Git your shovel and git to work.
I got two years.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Here, Mom.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
He's probably a gigolo.
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
What happened? How far did you get?
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Thass right. Just play it...
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Cuter.
Kick a buck.
Well, how far didya get?
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
Fear of what...
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
Andy?
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
About what?
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
But </u>alive</u>!
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
You already made the delivery?
She don't want it.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Who was the man in the basement?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
I think this is number three...
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
How do you know that?
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
That's no surprise.
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
I'll get a locksmith.
Go and look for a note.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Look at him, grandstanding...
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
Helen Hudson...
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
You got a suspect...
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
And her husband? What was he?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
No. But when he's in that car...
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
Are we imagining it?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
No.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Hard to say.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Then, you should call.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
Really?
Truly.
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
Do you think I should?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
I didn't say...
That's thanks to all your help.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Tomorrow?
You too, Mom.
When did you start smoking?
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
I guess so. I think that's right.
Letty.
By color.
That must be really difficult.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
The left one.
Exactly.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
No way.
But I do.     I love you, too.
Home free.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Open up.    I want to see.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Shhhh.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
Yeah?
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
You got wine. That's great.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
Congratulations.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Yes.
Can you loan me a 20?
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
I've met someone else.
It doesn't matter who.
What does that mean?
I'll float you.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
What?   This?
You're calling me on is phone?
You don't trust me?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
He missed three weeks.
I guess we're going to find out.
Half the tapes.
How about if I call you?
Thank you.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
No problem.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
It's me.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
What'd they take?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
I see.   A master criminal.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Mr. Taylor?
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
God, I want to go home.
Get in the car.
The hell it is.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Uh huh.
Oh, you think?
What?
Wait here.
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Glenmorangie.
And you don't speak French?
What does arresting us get them?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No.
After last night I could say the same for you.
Stick around and find out.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
A car.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
I'll never live as a thief!
Shut up!
I owe you nothing.
So what if I don't?
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
I have a guest.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You're too young to understand.
Really?
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
Kneel!
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
You coward!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Give me back my comb.
Give it back.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
What do you have in mind?
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
I'm buying.
No onions?
Fucking A, my friend.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
In a better place.  I hope.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
She's still dead.
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Another jolly nickname?
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Shut up.
I'm already alone.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
I don't think so.
That's right.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Forever.
No.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
A friend wrote me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
You implied it.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Doing what?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Of Human Bondage.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Oh please.
I do not.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
What are you saying?
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
Eww. No. That's gross.
It was nothing.
Okay.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
No.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Okay.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Well... not exactly.
No.
That's one way of looking at it.
You think he'll like it?
I want to go home.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Is it me?
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Who told you?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Get out of here.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Who is this?
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
It's Kathryn.
No.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
What?
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Blow me.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Yeah.
With who?
Mock, mock, mock.
And that's why you're leaving?
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
And if I don't?
I think you have your answer.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
I'll do that.
Do you know where she is?
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
What do you mean?
Oh, lots of times.
Sometimes.
At the old house with the voice.
Are they nice?
Yes, darling,
What do you mean?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Amy's been lying again.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I didn't forget.
But wishes don't come true.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
It's true.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
Because she is my friend.
You called me by my name.
I can not tell you.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Don't cry, Amy.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
That's the clever way to do it.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
But she's such a nice lady.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
Who is she?
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
My daughter died long ago.
Yes...yes, that's true.
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Now, I don't know Amy --
Come away, Amy.
Wait a minute. Listen.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
Go on -- out with you.
And Amy mailed them?
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Your lips look delicious.
Never felt better.
No, it was another woman.
No it's mom.
Anything's better than Mark.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
I don't know.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Okay, I gotta go.
Why not? There's been a murder.
What? Why'd you do that?
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
You should have seen it erect.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I think I already have.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Frida? You okay?
So you're Grant's secretary?
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
I'm not really hungry after all.
They say sex is great for cramps.
Knock what off?
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
So pay them back and apologize.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Yeah?
Your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
I'm sorry.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
No, take it.
She's just so... pathetic.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
We can just take this pillowcase.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
I told you she was innocent.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Not really...
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
The other one?
How will we interrogate them?
Loose ends?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Sorry, sir.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Why, yes.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
What is going on?
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
You seem restless.
You know something about me?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Well...
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
Great.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
) Listen, you little...
Well it's a last minute change.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Yeah.
I can't believe he'd do this.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Mild stroke?
Exactly. A condition.
I was a senator, you know.
What about her.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
I don't think so.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
I'm not sure.
Choices?
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Oh my gosh...
A teleprompter.
He's not.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
What?
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
I can't say.
No.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Oh... Okay.
What?
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
What?
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Leave him.
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
Ain't no place safe.
Maybe.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Come on. Let's go.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
I'm alright. Let's go.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Yep.
And English, and trig
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Except sex.
Garden?
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
I couldn't stop myself.
I told you, that's a secret.
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
I'm in.
All right.  I'll second that.
It's Nuwanda.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
It's better than doing nothing.
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Are you going with Chet?
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
I didn't know you taught.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
A madman.
A crazy madman.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Don't stop!
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Isn't there an easier way?
You have another choice.
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
Then you can help him.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Todd Anderson.
My brother went here.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
Do you have to quit the play?
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
What the hell are you talking about?
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
You hear that?
Jesus Christ lady...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
That's what I do.
On the side!!
You should talk...
What?
Not like him.
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
So?
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Line it up now, nice and easy...
I have been.
One whistle... Start the engine...
Nowhere...
You want some too?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Shut up!
John...
She fucked me.
Yeah.
John,we're going huntin'.
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
You're full of shit.
It's Nick!
I know, but...
Who? Who is?
She does not!
It won't open.
You mean...?
Worse since she talked to who?
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
I came to see Merle.
Yeah.
Where is he???
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Linda, yeah.
You know a guy named Merle?
Yeah?
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Sal's alive???
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
Right here.
Yeah.
Hell no!
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
I'm doing that too.
What do you think?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Sit down.
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
No!!!?
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
That's my plan.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What?
Listen, Nick --
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Merle gave me this?
Phantom Mary?
Yeah!
What's it for??
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
Sure.
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
That wasn't your plan, was it?
He could be brought back.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
What the hell are you talking about?
Keep 'em busy.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Doucet killed my partner.
Relax, let technology do the work.
Drop it.
I was set up.
Good night.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
No, sir.
Simulated one.
Not too good.
I'm signing off.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
Take a look at this.
They always are.
Hi.
We will --
I didn't.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
Young man -- you got me there.
Why? It don't hurt.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
That's just too bad --
Howdy, Hank.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
You are afraid!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I'm through with you.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
There's no joy in it for me.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Camomile tea!
Why not -- ?
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
We can still use my butter money.
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Jabez ...
Tired?
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Jabez!
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
I dunno.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
It's all right, Sheriff.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
I guess we won't.
I won't forget.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
I'll do my best, Mary.
Hullooo!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
I object.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Mind if I play some tunes?
That is Christmas music.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
John.
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
Tell me about it.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
And if he alters it...?						*
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Go fuck yourself.
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
I told you...
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Oh...Where does he live?
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
They're not after you, they're after me.
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Hello, Sonny.
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
I'm really shakey.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Yeah.  So how are you?
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
I know I am.  I know!
What?
Shit...
Are they on the phone still?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
That's good then.  You've found something.
Right.  See you sometime.
I can't talk to him.
What are you doin' in there?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
They're okay.
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
I frisk you?
What do you want?
Sonny, come on out!
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
He's all doped up.
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
Special to me, too.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Everything's all right?  You okay?
What about Howard?
You were terrific, too!
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
What?
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
Everybody!  Back here!
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Okay, Sonny.
I'm here.
I want them all.
What can he do, he's clean...
I am.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Sonny - Here's your document.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I said you were never a faggot.
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
What?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
<i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Take us to Vegas.
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Must you use that awful word?
I said stop it.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
There are no bond certificates.
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
Real good.
You got my back.
Yes?
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
Jade, I still love you.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
What was you saying?
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
We're still standing.
OK.  OK.
It's gonna be hot today.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
What is?
That's my name.
Can ya dig it?
It's a motherfucking shame.
Talk to your son.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Where we goin'?
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
When?
Come in then.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Trust me.
It's 'pose to be cold.
I am a man.
Magic Johnson.
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
Ya like him, huh?
We're outta here.
I love you.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Tell Vito.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
Tell Pino.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Depends how you define 'new'...
HARRY Dunne.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Come over around seven.
Yeah, but I'm buying.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
I'm fine.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
What? No! Look.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Home school. Til today.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
No.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Peg leg?
Will not.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
Put some ice on it.
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
Hey, where did you come from?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
A blimp.
Am not.
D2.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Roger that, Wilco.
And with that complete loser
Right.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
Not to expect you tonight.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
You're just jealous.
I'll talk to you later.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Tomorrow night?
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
We start our own class?
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
Who's there?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
Love it!
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
With your permission...
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Basically...
Is this what you seek?
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
Paul!!  Paul!!
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Where are we do you think?
No.
Always.
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Where?
Those sounds could be imitated.
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
The <u>women</u>?
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Who do I play?
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Mmph?  Where am I?
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I don't know.  Where?
You mean a Tesla coil?
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
What do you mean?
These shoes are itchy.
We'll do our best.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Boris Karloff!?
I thought he was dead.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Toss us out on our ass.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Does she have room for me?
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
I understand you just moved here?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
What other sixty-thousand?
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Hruphh...?
Would that work?
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
Yes?
Tor!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
But Greta say --
Yes?
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
So you're not a fruit?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
Oh.  Congratulations.
What do you mean?
Okay?
The poor girl's out of a job.
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Lines around the block.
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Um, yeah -- thanks.
No, uh...
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
When? Today?
Right.
Oh.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Oh my God!
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
Why? How...
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
What are you talking about?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Never would be plenty.
Yeah.
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
What?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So?
Come on, let's go.
What did you do to your hair?
What?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
What?
Screw off.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
We'd better go...
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
No problema.  You want a picture?
No. Am I supposed to?
What...
Hi.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
What kind of person?
Dick.
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
Yes, I do.
Thanks, Mr. M.
I know.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Sure
Good luck, Tracy.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
Sporty.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
That sounds good.
Yes?
You will.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
I have proof.
Dave.
Three twenty-five.
You're there.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
For what?
What do you mean?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Don't you fucking knock?
Paul, get out!
Till 19-fucking-70.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
Are you sorry she's dead?
It's Lynn.
You fuck for money.
Yeah.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
It's Bud.
Yeah.  But not for long.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
This business, Captain?
Homicide?  A detective?
Of course... But how?
I got to write my report first.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
No!  Please leave!
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Against your code?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
Susan Lefferts.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Nothing.
I don't have time.  I have --
Say what and so what.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
I never truck with no sissies!
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Say what?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
What's this all about, lad?
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
What about you?
Just don't shoot me.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
What?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Some reality.
You, me and White, huh?
Right now, before I back down.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
And no one'll know about this?
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
I'm telling you, I--
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
Who are you calling?!
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Do it!
A direct one.
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
You're crazy.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
They're spooks.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
I called my wife!
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
Jesus.
That wasn't so hard.
No he won't.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
What about newspapers and magazines?
What if--
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
I'll say.
Pardon?
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
About what?
Because I don't know.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
No, sir.
To buy lingerie.
Yes sir.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
How could you let me find out like this?
Robert--
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Stacy--
That's gonna end tonight.
It's over.
Don't count on it.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
Oh.
It tastes like fish.
When do I get to meet him?
It's how he works.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
He doesn't work that way.
All right, look--
Who's doing this?
We're screwed.
You have to.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
Yeah.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
We believe he did.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
We'd rather not--
--otherwise we may have to--
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Oh, well, that's true.
Brill.
Good point.
What are you talking--
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
Table 122?
Christ!
Bobby--
Why would they--
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
Yeah.
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
I honestly don't know.
I said fuck you.
We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
He's clever. He had help.
I just meant--
Oh, let's assume that they have.
Do you have visual?
What's your ETA?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
As the wife of one of our party.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
That makes it harder still.
It's a folk song.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
Don't go over it again, please.
You will.  You will.
What?
No.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
Don't talk.
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
What's the matter with you?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Right.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Okay.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
So you can shoot a pistol?
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
What?  How could he have?  When?
She can take you as far as Florence.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
Are you planning to be the exception?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
Moose.
Very true!
I see.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't… I couldn't even do that properly.
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
What?
Candaules
Yes?
Your friend?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Never heard of it.
I've met you before.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
I try not to expect you.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Kip… I -
I'll always go back to that church.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
What's he saying?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
I don't recall asking your permission.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
He's on to something bigger.
No you can't.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Uh, yes.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
Not a word.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
I'm not the one to ask...
Certainly not mine. Come on.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
No. It's a down payment.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
It's---beautiful.
I've got something for you.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Duh.
Shut up.
What?
There is no big job.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
I'd taken the Mask?
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You've thought of everything.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
Charged.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
What about you?
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
This is big enough.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
It better be worth it for me.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
You know where my loyalties lie.
I figured that out.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
It's those files you asked for.
What's your point?
So you say.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
You're a lawyer?
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Right.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Any school you want.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
If you hadn't used profanity --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Excuse me?
Don't bother.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
That's crazy -- why not?
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
Show me the document that proves that.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
And, what, I'm not serious?
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Erin --
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Yesterday.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Have you been to the water board?
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Why not?
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna clean it up.
What?  But you been working so hard --
Keep your voice down.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
What's that?
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
What's going on?
<u>Excuse me</u>?
What?
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Come in, Admiral.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
And that is why I must go.
Growls a reserved greeting.
We're not out of this yet.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
What happened?
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
What is it?
Sit down, and shut up!
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Han, we need you here.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
What was it?
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Or you ran into something ....
What is it?
How do I look?
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Why?
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
You mean a man you can control.
Where?
The entrance is collapsing!
You're going to attack them?!!!
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Never heard of that system.
Can you trust him?
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
We have no use for your kind.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
What are you talking about?
Han's leaving?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
That is why you fail.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
It is the future you see.
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Never.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
I want that ship.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
What's in it for me?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Delgado?
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
Are you crazy?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
I'm looking for somebody.
Yeah.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
So be it.
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
I will run.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
I'm not jealous!
Just show the sword.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
To kill and be king, is that all?
Fuck it.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
Why don't you let me?
Burke.
Me too.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
What's her name?
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Yes, I think so.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Pretty close.
No.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Could you see her?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
No.
No
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
The closet
No you don't. I do it all the time.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
He's nice.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Cause I like it.
I wouldn't talk.
I don't know
Well I heard differently.
Why does God let us get tired?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Damien Karras.
Okay.
So what's wrong with her?
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
How's the girl?
You might loosen the straps then.
In here. With us.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
But deliver us from the evil one.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
In the face of the enemy.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Her heart.
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
Only what I read in the papers.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Come on!
Are you tired?
Bastards! Stop!
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Just a minute.
Yes.
Twelve.
I don't know.
You're not going to drive!
Your pay.
Take it now.
Swimming trunks.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Get your hand off me.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Lotta water.
Jack...
Fuck him.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
I hate your kids, Frank.
Yamaha white.  Nice.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Why the interest?
It's more than that.
So do I.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
I don't gotta go.
Says who?
You'll see.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
We don't get a gig.
Yeah, okay.
What?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Talk.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
What?
Let's get it over with.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
I'll drop the eighths.
It's early.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
How about these?
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
Yeah.  Something.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
Fine.
No. Why?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
He was just having fun.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
Twenty-eight years.
I don't know. Some disease.
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
What're you doing?
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Just call me a cab.
All right.
All right.
Right.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
My watch is broken, too.
Don't take it personally.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
What's he talking about?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Big feet.
They're nines.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Yeah.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
He doesn't bite.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
The name's Baker --
Downstairs.
He leads, I follow.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
The Stratford.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
I guess in case one year they're not.
In and out.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Guess I got a little scattered.
Who's Nina?
How come you didn't close your eyes?
You're kidding.
So, what happened?
Look, if you want to leave...
There's always another girl.
We outgrew each other.
If I see him.
Losing his teeth.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Eddie did.
Looks old.
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
He hit a guard.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
We need to talk.
Must've been after we got engaged.
So you had a nightmare.
Were you there to catch me?
How come?
Don't hang up ...
What more proof do you need?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
I'm going to have you fired.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
You mean like ... condoms?
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
-- I've got to study.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
Call me spontaneous.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Excuse me?
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
What’s going on here?
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
Got it.  Good tip.
That’s where you work.
Like what?
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Is it...?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
Pretty much.
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
It’s your birthday? Today?  What’s your name?  Where were you born?
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Hey...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
Everyone needs something.
Me?
I've got everything I need.
What?!
Give me my goddamn life back!
Please.  Just tell me what’s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
How much time?!
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Maybe you’re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
I was in the city.
Because you’ll be here.
Uh huh...
...my feet are hurtin’...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Do what?
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
That’s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
What...?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I’m gonna take you to that special place...
No, open it...
Zeena...
But I’m gettin’ close, right?
Worse, you mean...
But you always seem so certain.
It’s wonderful...
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
Don’t worry about it, Jack...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Where is he?
Okay, I’ll take them...
Merry Christmas...
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Victor's better at these things.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Ben.  Are you okay?
Got it, teach.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Is it safe?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
What do you mean "complete"?
What about you?
Right, whatever, have fun.
So are you!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Johnny.
Okay, "mom."
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Ben did this.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
What?  What do you mean you --
We need to get past them.
Excuse me?
What in the world would give me that idea?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>were</u>?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
Raising the shields.
Just <u>find</u> him.
Susan.  What are you doing?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
Medical's ready.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
The less time, the better.
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
The Other Side got to him.
<Me>?
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
We must!
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
That's what they pay me for.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Quite a piece of plumbing.
Oxygenation...
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Then why not take it?
At an operation?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
Two in a row?
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Sort of.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Uh -- what?
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Jezhush.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
No, that's not it, Jerry.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
My wife! What the - how's -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Oh, geez.
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
GOT IT?
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
You have children?
I unnerstand.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Uh-huh... A what?
Uh-huh.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Yah?
Hold on.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Okay.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Ya got the car?
Yah, okay.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
We might be innarested.
Yah.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Nope.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Yah.
Yah?
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Yah...
Uh-huh.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Gotta go?
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah?
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
What'd he say?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Still missing. We're looking.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
They're real good.
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Three-cent stamp.
Yah.
It's terrific!
He's at Norstar.
Well -
Where's Tyler?
We're still men.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Oh.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
Really?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You can't have the whole brain!
Should we?
Goodbye.
Please.
I could check your prostate.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Whatever.
It was the smart move on her part.
What do you get out of it?
What?
We did make love?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
You are an insane person.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
I'm sorry, but I...
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Don't ask.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
My suitcase was vibrating?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Now, find your power animal.
No, supply oxygen?
There's always that.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Like hell.  That counted.
Anyone?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
I'm fine.
Yes, I promise.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
A liposuction clinic.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, I'm not...
We don't... ?
Work.  Going to work.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Imagine how he feels.
What should I have told you?
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
I want to know --
What's this all about, Tyler?
I don't know!  Tell me!
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
Green?  Did you say green?
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
You need me.
Why are you doing this?!
Very good, Sir.
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
You told me you'd say that, too.
There is no money.
You and your friend.
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Signs?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
I have to save Eugene!
We need to hurry.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Take my van!
I've got to stop and help those people.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Who is this guy, anyway?
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
I...I don't know.
Yeah?
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Most kids never have it happen.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Let us out!
No! No! Don't!
Look, there's something you should all know.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
You saying Tod did kill himself?
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
What just happened?
There's the Mekong.
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Read you.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
No.
There are no worse places.
No cigarettes.
Fermented fish sauce.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Powerful warrior.
American?
Alright.  Home run.
Yes.
Spooks?
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
What's the plan?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
That's right.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Christ almighty.
What?
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
That's it.  My life.
Those men are all dead.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Really?
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
No, I'm fine... really...
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
And who's Lydia?
What does that mean?
Thank you very much.
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
How have you been?
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Where?  Maybe we can.
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
Yes... I... I agree...
No, I have to work.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Great place huh?
My name is Parry.
Sshhhh!
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
I don't know.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
You won't be alone for long.
No just Parry.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
There isn't any more to tell.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
A wig?
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
That's right, hand.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
Yes.
What the hell is that?
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Okay...
What?
I don't, huh?
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Fill it up.
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Palm Apodaca.
How do you know it's clean?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
I didn't get it, did I?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Are you talking to us?
Now don't...
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Who's Van Oost?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Tita, I've got to go...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Why are you being so mean?
Where's Catherine?!
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
Bye, Robert.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
That's dangerous, you know.
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
I gave it a second thought.
Yes, that's what's important to me...
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
No, the last time was three years ago.
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
It's a Borzoi.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
It is true.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
That's an old maid's tale.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
There's some good things on it, though.
Why you have an attitude for?
Nothin'.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
You look good.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Wussup, Victor.
I got punished, man.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
C'mon.
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
A girl named Amanda.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Not really.
Nah.
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
You're kidding.
Fletch, this is dumb.
Not luck. They don't want me.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
We play tennis at the club.
Yes.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Just relax.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Fletch...
I'm serious, Sam.
Affirmative.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
I'm fine.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Yes, right away.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Where are you going?
You sure did.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Yeah. Maybe.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Charmed.
Who?
Come inside.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Sure, all drifters do.
You sure those doors will be open?
No problem, boss.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
You doing a story on this guy?
I'm sorry?
You've met her?
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
So were my parents.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
It's amazing.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
What is this?
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
That's what I want to know.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I think you better sit down.
You shouldn't be here.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
I recommend it.
Sierra del fuego.
What?
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Who are you?
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
What about finding the source?
Get out of here.
You were going to can me, right?
John!
In a minute!
But I ain't got you...
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
I'll do my best.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Johnny's C.D.?
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Did he just say what I think he said?
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Only on a first name basis.
Hey, the poet...
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
I'm clean.
No - no.
Doesn't register.
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
What?
Where from?
Yeh?  Who else?
Where the hell is it?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
I can't.
We put him to bed for the night.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Third time around.
I been damn careful up to now.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
So what?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Well, why not a little of the King?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I love you more.
I know.  He loves that thing.
I'm serious.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Daddy, I'm scared.
Wait...
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Uh huh...
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
I never knew you, Dad.
Tell me.
I'm glad.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Sully!  Is that you?
Longbranch...?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Whoa, I just...I just...
Yeah.  That's it.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Yeah.  Sure.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Yeah, that's right.
A hot shot, huh?
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Cool it, Andy.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
I vote for me.
Yes, man!
I love you, man!
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
You go ahead...
Your bed.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
You're Shelly?
Yes.
It was nothing.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Don't say any more.
I have to.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
My ass.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Daddy, what is going on?
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Uh...yes.  But...
No.
'Cause it stinks.
Did you hear me?!
Are they grown-ups?
We'll scare 'em right back.
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I've seen it.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
N...nothing.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
That's what I'd like to know.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
About what?
She did!
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
What are you going to do?
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
It's...dead.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
Where is she?
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
Walking corpses are not real!
What are you talking about?
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Just felt a little chill.
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
But I didn't get you one...
I'd love to.
Where are they?
Just radio for help, okay???
The window...
Where you're going, mister?
What did you find?
You are going where?
Very bad today.
That's where I peed.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Asbestos lining.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
Do not inhale.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
It's your best play, Nicky.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
She's dying.
I talked to her two days ago.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Why do you need a radio?
That's completely crazy.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
It's only our first date.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Mystery. Deception.
Yes.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
I'm at the door.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
It's a simple subject.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Life is good.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
You're out of bullets.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Burnt sienna.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
Yes.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
As I told you about English policemen.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
One more.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
Well, we shall try.
Did they take your clothes?
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
"Hell!"
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
Hm.  Is it?
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
It's split the Government.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
It would be five thousand more.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
Any particular reason?
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
You may as well invite her here.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
Not bad, Jerome.
In case you get back before I do.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
I hope he's not just a body.
How do I square the accident?
How tall are you?
Why not?
I've found him too.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Yes.
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
You'll be next.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Those checks take forever.
Let's walk.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
We could go together one day.
Only every time I'm in here.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
I'm not doing it.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
I want to take a walk.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Just the way I remembered.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
Is he straight?
Want to cry now?
Bullshit.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
And switched keys.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
You bastard...
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
I mean it.
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
Let's do it.
Sure...
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
What's wrong?
Where do we go from here?
Pull over.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Might try that.
Okay. How many bank exits?
What about the vault?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Just... tell us what you want.
Can he trust you?
When did you find out?
Yes. I told him.
What happened to this car?
I know.
Yes.
What name?
Why?
Good evening.
That's nice.
Yes.
Really?
No.
Really?
So where are we going, Princess?
Entertaining.
You've been watching the film.
Your brother? What you talking about?
Nice of you to come.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Working at Woolworths.
At me friend's house.
Right.
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Large Scotch.
Good lad.
Who's Brumby?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Definitely.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
Pension him off.
Yes, thank you.
No, I didn't know that.
Making a living.
We've got to take you back to London.
They do that up North.
...Polacks...
To get on the...
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
Well, I think I had one once.
They came in and they, you know...
They killed the goose.
And now...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
He is?
With River Oaks?
Himself?
That's the truth...
That's what I...
They...
How?
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
Yes.
Did you talk to Graff?
You're saying "me."
What?
I...
No.
That's none of your fucking business...
Uh-huh.
What do you care...?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
It's a waste of time.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
What?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
No.
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
That they're going to be upset.
Excuse me...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
You're done, come down, and let's...
Get in the goddamn room.
Shelly, you blew the last...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
Murray...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Murray said...
And what if you don't close.
Now.  Yes...When?
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I have to go... 
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
That was easy, wasn't it?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
Mmm.
From the store.
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Which...
Oh!  For the magazine...
Kenilworth...?
Kenilworth.
Me.
Did I...?
Mmmm...
Gimlet.
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
If we wait till Mon...
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Not to my knowledge, no...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
You did?
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
I got lots of presents.
To do business.
That's right.
We have no money for a rug.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
Tom is right.
The children can stay.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
What's that?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
...Who?
But, you told me yourself...
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
I don't know.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
I can't let him down.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
But if you're wrong...
Wait... there's something else.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Mike, at three and a half...
I don't know.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Did my brother go back?
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Do you owe markers?
He is, I believe, a brother.
The witness is excused; take him out.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
Sleeping inside me.
Yes, Michael, it does.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Yes.
I do not.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Turnbull is a good man.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
Sitting right behind you.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
We got no choice.
What about Michael Corleone?
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
How much more a month?
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
The Master is waiting for you.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Of course.  I am married still.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Huh?
But why?
You don't say?  Which picture?
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
No.  I'm fine.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Can't today.
No.  I --
But we have to match the other sketch.
What happened?
Not me.
I didn't --
You're the one who started it.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
If that's okay?
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Catch my death.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Not at all.
I don't remember that one.
What won't do?
What was that?
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
I think I'll hang around.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Yes.  Perfectly.
More your line.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
Of course.  This afternoon.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Quite.
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
Head.  Not heart.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Don't go away.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
Point-five ...
Yes ... Kip ...
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
Let them go --
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
A little family emergency --
Something like that -
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Cadillac.
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
It's all microchips and shit ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
We don't -- ?
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
What time of year?
Mother -- !
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Hello, Memphis --
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Something like that -
What do you got ... ?
Me...
The family that steals together, deals together...
Price of doing business...
What?
I know ...
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Run it...
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
What are you doing here?
Mitch.
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
Six or seven...
I understand -
I always thought you'd follow me up.
Oh. Okay. Right.
Deodorant.
What about The Club ... ?
And Tracy's on the move ...
How is he -- ?
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
I dunno. I know a place.
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Of course. Hi, Junie --
He's gotten involved --
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Not really -
Excuse me --
Oh I Him.
Nods.
Nods again.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
What are you gonna do?
What bag?
That again.
It'll be okay.
I can't do it anymore.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
I gotta talk to you.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
Done.
He heard.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Yeah.
Oh shit.
All right, then.
--or a tail--
Why not?
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
No, I had to talk him down.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Ah, history I think.
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
Yah, all right...
I told you, I just got change.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
History.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
What're you doing?
Really?
That's right.
It's an integer proof.
I think so.
Half-red, half-black--
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Hey, how you doin'?
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
It's Saturday.
Pleasure to meet you.
Uh-oh.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
I got your card.
That would be fine.
I'll be okay.
I won't talk first.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Who?
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
I don't know. India maybe.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
What did you think?
You think so?
This is a real piece of shit.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
What?
Yeah.
I didn't ask for this.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
It's not...
What?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
No.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Not a chance.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Exactly.
Clearly.
I guess so.
No.
Yeah, but how do you know?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
I'm not honest?
No, you don't want to hear that.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Goodbye.
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
But ain't no reason--
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
Now I can't breathe.
Naw. They paroled me.
Gallon or two?
Okay. Go on.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Two.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
Joad. Tom Joad.
An' you say no cops?
Why ain't they more like it?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Crate fell on me.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
You're right!
Thought you was in jail.
Lissen, I heard that before--
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Yeah.
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Take her with you!
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Okay. I be back a little later.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
He was a good man.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
I wisht it was day.
Won't they ketch us?
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
What do you want to do?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Insane.
Overflowing with love.
Yes.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Bad people.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
What?
Like heroin?
No.
It's something I do...
Jesus Christ!
That's probably a good idea.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
We're both professionals, Oatman.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Hard to get good help these days.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
That sounds pretty interesting...
Those all seem kind of related...
I don't think so.
It was the PLO.
He using her.
He didn't.
It's a place where religious people--
Yeah...
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
It is. It's lovely.
I won't ask you to.
Why?
What about him?
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
Whatever you want.
I didn't know I had to.
No, you just act like you do.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
I think they call it a pasture.
You already did.
About what?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
My period.
What?... Oh baby...
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Tch. What are you --
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
Doing what?
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
Why?!
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
I was there for that shot, actually.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Oh, how sweet.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
You!
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
No thanks.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
That's what some folks say.
Weekend after next...
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
You know, you're a good kid.
She's an editor.
I don't know if I can.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
OK, OK.
Maybe... look -- just...
Oh yeah...
I understand...
You ever miss it?
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Waste the dude.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
That's far out!
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
It was him, man!
I'm gonna hit you!
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Difficulty rating?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
Curtis.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
How did you know that?
Burn!
What's this one eat?
We did it!
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
If I win, you become my slave.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
I'll make it up to you!
I'll hack the Gibson.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
You would have looked better.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Don't get angry.
We've been better.
She's not dead!
I don't know!
Brady! Come with us.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
How do you know their not?
I'm not calling the fire department.
Outside.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
I can't sleep.
Like a sister?
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
It was the nightmare man
No.
I've got you come on, go down.
Dad, what's going on?
Why?
All right.
Hi.
Don't you mean what you do best?
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
I don't know.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
He's been here.
Least I'm not alone.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What happened?
Huh?
We just talked.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Fun-ny. See you.
Look where?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
I wasn't spooked.
He was watching me.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Annie!
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Lee Brackett.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
What did he look like?
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
No! Do as I say.
You're coming with us...
Are there any special instructions?
Mmm?
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Oh.
A lot of works.
Uh --
Right.
No, he called late last night.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Yeah.
Let's take a look.
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Like what?
Ed Smythe, yes.
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
...cannot go on the air.
I don't know exactly.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
No?
Yes, he's just adorable.
Did you ever read this one--?
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Why, you know the situation.
Not because of me, I hope.
But not over me?
I can't say anything!
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
Was I?
But, you got four children!
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Leave me alone, can you?!
Get his wine away.
Always.
Oh, honey!
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Mom, come out!
Because he likes you.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Oh, Frederick!
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
No.
You know... 
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Oh, me, I'm okay.
How are you?
Oh, now-- 
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I think we need to eat.
I know...I know.
I got two minutes.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
That's a beauty!
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
...from Mavis, also.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Yeah.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Oooo.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Really?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Well, I just came from an audition...
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
We didn't hit it off.
Oh, no.
Yeah?
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Really?
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
Oh.  Oh.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Oh, yeah?  What?
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
...which I did not get.
April?
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Take our literature...
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
...you don't have to think.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...I was <u>working</u>...
I have not read you your rights.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
I'm not.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
I know her by the Back.
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...would you excuse me...?
What's up...?
They got that kind of money?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Impossible.
You take this much time over everything?
Seen what, sir..?
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
Exactly.
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
You seen John Brigham...?
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
I think its meaning is clear.
You nervous...?
I said sometime it gets so...
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Spoken like a Protestant.
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
...not to turn around.
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
What shape is the scar?
Hey, lost again.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
...yes, yes, yes....
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
...no...
...would you use a small word?
Yes.
...yes...?
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because?
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
You are the prince of the darkness.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
What are you gonna do about it?
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Your Secret admirer?
Goodnight.
That wants to be a Yes.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
I just never thought of you in that...
So what?                                                    ]
Iunno.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
It's been known to happen.
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Because you're an idiot.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
No.
Yeah, I just got back.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Sure.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Like a suicide thing?
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Next channel, darling.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Remember he's left-handed.
I was just making it more special.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
What?
Punch it in!
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
May<u>be</u>.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Get a job.
That's three things.
But my name's not...
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Come on through.
frowns at Henry.
Is it hurting, dear?
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
But she'll have no one to look after her!
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
sighs.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
hurries over.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
That . . .
What??
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Yes . . .
All right, then.
Your wife...?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Your insight is enlightening.
The way you just looked at me...
I'm stumped.
You just made that up.
Well?
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
What?
This isn't happening.
Really, why's that?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Ambulance.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
YOU!
Try stupid.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Allen?  He... he's okay?
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
I got your bail continued.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
What picture?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
You're sitting on your ticket.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Said he's not an actor.
She's talking to him now.
She can't quit.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
What's "cynical"?
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
How are they with kids?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Okay.
Whoa, check it out.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
I understand that.
That would be stupid.
-- a sense of proportion.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I've asked him what's wrong.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
What?
Stop knowing me so well.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Huh?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
He wasn't there.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Shut up.
What for, dickweed?
Really.
No joke, Lieutenant.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
We don't have any proof of that.
I think it was England.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
Lieutenant.
Central Park.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Is that it?
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
For what?
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
Aye.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
I'll be fine.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
You're twenty minutes late.
I know.
No.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
We'll see.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Why did you wait?
I don't know.
Me too.
It's not for me to decide.
I'll no forget you.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
No.  The money, please.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
What do you want to do?
I understand.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Like what?
I'm not going to die for this!
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
I'm here.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Okay.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Use more ice.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
I got the gasoline --
I overheard him with the girl.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
You fucked up, Glen.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
I don't drink beer.
Mars?  What are you doing?
Whatever.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Go, Chief.
Go.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Yes, sir.
Special Agent Jones.
Where's the office?
In my room.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Can you get into the office?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Yes.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
Of course.
Let me see your identity card.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Where is your family?
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Where is she?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Their people?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I can't, I don't have the men.
What did they say?
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
No, sir.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
Listen, you need me.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Promoted. House Manager.
I would never do that.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Why sir?
Call, sir?
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
I need a great favor.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
How do you know?
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Get in.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What about us?
But who is left?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
So where is the lamb?
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
In Ruhengeri?
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
There is one thing I need right away.
Why?
What's wrong?
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
How dead?
He has taken the presidential suite.
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Can I help you?
What is his room number?
Go downstairs, I will help you.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
So what stopped her?
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
I'm moved beyond words.
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Oh dear.
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Yes.
Poor Mr. Price --
It's not going to let us out!
Over here!
And we get this money when?
Take the gun.
Best of a nightmare.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
Why?
Most fun I've had all day.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
Let's try down here...
That's crazy!
He's gotta still be down here.
He's dead...?
I don't do groups.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
Steven??
You didn't think to ask?
My wife. Where were we?
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
I never saw you --
-- no more --
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Why not?
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Over here.
Keep talking, I'll find you!
What's the matter?
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
What will they tell you?
Why don't you pass me your plate?
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
She talks to me.
We'll get it later.
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
My God, I heard something!
Daddy help!
Good night daddy.
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
To our family.
Or what she was worth.
What?
So what are you saying?
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Aubrey!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
What?
What are you talking about?
What's happening!
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
Before.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
White meat will be fine...
So what should we do, father?
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Good night.
What are you getting at!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
And what would you do?
Not at all, if it can help.
What?
Well what is it!
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Right.  Right!
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Sorry.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Can we see?
You're JP Monroe, right?
No.  Really?
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Not quite.
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Something like that.
Gum.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Rutherford Auction... that name...
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
You sound disappointed.
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Let's just forget it, I mean...
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
You're supposed to be dead!
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
God go with you, sister.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
You want an address on that last one?
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
Alchemy.
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
The Hipster!
The Hudswinger!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
I'm happy enough.
I'm plenty happy!
He didn't offer you money.
You know, on farm route 17.
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Watch it, Archer --
Terrific.
Forty-eight years...
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
...Geez.
I --
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
And Sid says you stole it!
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Well, why don't ya read it.
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
I haven't had --
I --
You --
Well, I made the dean's list.
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
Oh my God, sir!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
Old Faithful.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
He don't look wise.
Thank you for waking me.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
Alive?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
Mr. Holland?
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
I'm sorry...
And charming?
Good morning.
Why did you come in here?
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
Got a meeting uptown.
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
No thank you. We should be off.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
See for yourself.
You think I --
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
I'm not.
Fine.
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Birth control.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
I just can't believe you could be so --
Good night kiddo.
Nah.
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
With Mikey?
Mom. Are you ok?
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
It's really quite all right.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Do what?
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
The Idiot?
Great, thanks for the tip.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
Out.
Tell Sandy? What?
Then why'd you come after me?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Huh?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Yeah.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Can I come?
What time is it?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Hey Sandy.
Yeah? See ya.
One more shot?
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
I had him!
Too bad...
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Twelve years younger.
Then change it.
Worth pursuing?
Where is he?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
What time was that?
No.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
How do you mean?
Even the best make mistakes.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
The other guy?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Did you have sex with her?
You mean we are not children of Satan?
Then God does not exist...
Your lover.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
That's what the one who made me said.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
What night? What do you mean?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Sit still. It's not finished -
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Don't mock, Claudia...
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
And you never cried -
Yes...
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
But if she dies...
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
I want it!
How do you mean, start?
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
It can't be...
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
NO!!!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
What are you saying?
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is that bad?
What about a radio?
What the hell would you call this?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
They never found the body.
I've got to see.
Ray, we're just friend.
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Fine. Show me the body.
I told you.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
I'm okay.
What?
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
How much?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
In case you do so, would you --
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
This was once a cemetery.
I donut understand.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
I think not.
On my word! That's what they believe.
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
They shall not hurt you
Thea is an orphan.
You have forgotten my last name?
That should decide it or you --
Whet do you mean?
Miss Wollsten!
Really, this is idiotic!
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Her family name?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
You are my friend.
If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
He hates all my race.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
I hate to do this, fella.
Carter –– bank examiner.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Where is she?
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
That's the kid.
Well, wait and see.
No!
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Uh-huh.
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
All in . . .
I'm all right.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm?
No.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Yes –– charge.
Aw, get going!
Oh, George.
He's pretty young for that job.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Say, where's Mother?
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
It's important.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
I'll take chocolate.
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Neither am I.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Do you like it?
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Would you rather leave?
Thank you.
That does it –– come here.
My baby.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Going up to see Zuzu.
George, darling! Where have you been?
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Oh, shucks . . .
I hope that's the cousin.
They're moving pretty fast.
Yeah.
We better go back in.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
We're hung up on something.
Sean!  Catch it!
Want to swim home?
Over here!
The rope!  The rope!
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
In here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
Right.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
I kind of had plans....
Did you get any pictures?
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Is that what it is?
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
We don't know that, do we?
So there's one around here.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Why?
For me?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Nothing, huh?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Mike's out there.
Two of them are still missing!
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
That's it?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
That's what he said.
Next week.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Mike?  Our Mike?
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Anything?
Until we find something.
What the hell is it?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
I can go out if I want to.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Might as well.
Sean, baby, please....
Yeah.
Quiet!  Shhh!
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
I can get it.
With those camera lights and...
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Hope I make it through both.
Don't forget you have your brother.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Get out of here!
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
They just wanted to say hello.
Nothing.
That we swim.
I know I can capture it.
You don't.
No,  I'm not going through there.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
I don't understand.
Who's going to do it?
Michael, you're not going down there.
I'm  fine.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Yes, aren't we all.
Make this quick!
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
No!
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Afraid I can't do that.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Thanks to you.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
Ten minutes ago.
How you doing, Kelly?
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
The one that goes underwater?
It's okay, Sean.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Now what?
It's disappeared.
Hey.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Hey, I don't want to hear.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
It's large enough...
... I'll go to McDonalds.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Don't hurry back.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
But you always let me....
He told me you both did....
It sure is....
Tell Matt he should be here....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
They're at the beach....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
It's beginning....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
Thank you....
Who's coming?
Mother....
Okay.
Mom, please don't start that again....
I'm not going to quit now....
Good.
I'm fine....
There's nothing to worry about....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
Good.  I have two left....
That's hard to imagine....
What?
I'm sorry...I....
Yes you can....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
Good news travels fast....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
What's that....?
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
The females have eggs....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Put me down....
Put me down, damnit....
Holy shit!
Gave them the day off....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
So did I....
What?
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Maybe the gear crapped out....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
You don't like my voice...?
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Mom....
I've got to get to her....
In a few minutes....
I'm training to....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Oh no--
"Welcome to Eureka."
The <u>dogs</u>?
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Because, don't get into it ...
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
No, you didn't.
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
I was wrong.
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
What are you looking for?
Wrong cabinet.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
He ain't offerin me shit.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
No.
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
You said, you were in the bad lands?
Have you known her long?
He said that? What else did he say?
Which is what?
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Then why didn't he kill me?
I'm blind because my father drank.
I don't want them to arrest you.
The man from the F.B.I.
You find something curious in that?
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Even better.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
Ask him.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
No.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
I see what you're saying.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
You think so?
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Absolutely.
Same to you.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Well, I'm happy for you.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
We will be fine!
Good evening.
You don't have to explain.
Yeah, what happened there.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
What?
Fine, I just --
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
Please, if I start talking --
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
I'll give it everything.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Okay.
Very much.
Oh my God.
No, I don't know.
No.
Go.  Flee.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
Dick.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
-- and I'll get 'em.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Yeah I know.  I did.
I'm scared.  What is it?
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
What is it?
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
What?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
People change.
I filmed this the morning they left.
We have to help him.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
Here!
What about Eric?
DAD!
I didn't know, there were two islands.
I thought you were an expert.
They're here.
Baryonyx?
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
You think they could talk to each other?
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
A well-accepted theory.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Yeah.
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
It certainly does.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
John . . .
-- my --
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
I want to see the nesting ground!
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
I don't even know this woman.
My vacation is over in a week.
Which one?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
What?  Why?
Okay.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Piss.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
You're going too?
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
What do you think they want?!
Where's Kelly?
It'll hold!
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Why should they?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Birdshit?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
I'm trying!
JUMP!
Where's Ian?
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Can the kid walk?
Damn!
The door security systems are shutting down.
Where did the vehicles stop?
How would we cut off the lysine?
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
They died together?
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
They smell.
The Cretaceous.
We're out of a job.
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
The fences are electrified, right?
The other car!
They're not here.
What's that?
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Like hell it is!
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
And scary.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Yeah.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
Listen, ahh - -
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
That's a good idea.
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
You have no idea.
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Kids get scared.
You're sure?!
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Yes.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Sure.
Thanks for the presents.
They don't bother me.
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
You want to put in chain saws?
Great.
You have a map.
What about that other guy?
He... he's here...
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
What?
Compared to this guy... amateur.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
That's open to debate.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Yeah, what is it?
About ten minutes.
I don't know what you could have read.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
In a manner of speaking.
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Yes.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
Sit down, Kafka.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
Why would you suppose so?
I've never seen you here before.
I suspected that he -- well.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
What of it?
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
It usually is.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Oskar.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
And we're upset too.
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
It's ... lovely.
Now Ann ...
I photographed it extensively, father.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
We're leaving.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Jack!...  Jack!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
Native costume?
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
You think people hate you.
Didn't want you.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
No, that's not --
Here please.
My name's John Klute.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
What about everything since?
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
You said you wanted these.
And I don't think that was Tom.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
-- Then you don't need me.
How?
Why?
No.
Mm.
Yeah.
I was wondering what that was.
Right back at the start, right?
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Trask wants to talk with you.
You're going back?
They don't scare me any more.
Well as a matter of --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Just send me a money order.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
I wanted to give it to you first.
Goodbye, Pete.
She told me.
I think she's trying that.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
What else do you know?
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Yes sir, we know he --
He's in his room, playing.
Detroit.
What about your mommy?
In real life when does he hit you?
Ladies and gentlemen...
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
You got a letter from mom.
In a minute...
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
I'm allergic to onions.
No.
No!
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
You mean for good?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
It's my name too.
You like it?
Yep.
No.
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Who will read me my stories?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Sustained.
Then I have concluded my questions.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Objection!
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
No.
Do you have a lover now?
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What?
I don't know...
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
You've been living here, in the city?
You want what?!
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, do you love him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--
I don't know, Jim...
Are you firing me, Jim?
Sure.
Yes, what?
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Kramer--
I'm going to take it.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
I know....I know.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Got it.
I'm sure.
Uh, huh...
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Khambas are wild men.
Cow.
No cried?
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
I will not approve it.
General Chiang.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
Time to study.
How many?
Roughly five thousand men.
Ask whatever you will.
Can India help us?
And, America?
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
I will not go.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
But you will always be here?
Is that true or pretend?
Pretend.
I would not know. Maybe.
Ahh.
But, I have no experience.
We cannot.
How could I ever leave?
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Thank you.
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
And you like me.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
They don't really attack underwater and--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
That's actually the easy part.
You ready on shore?
You do?
You talk to Bickerman?
That hurt my feelings.
I never had sex with you!
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
Guess I finally got bit.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
What?
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
That's probably good.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Good idea.
Yeah.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
Where is he?!
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
I can look at dead things.
It's just that--
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
You like Jack?
Hector thinks you like him.
You think Jack's handsome?
He said he knew Karate!
She's worried about the cow now.
Kevin, hey.
Absolutely.
The somebody else part?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
<u>Kelly</u>--
Wild guess.
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
He's here, Ardelia.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Well, except for the one girl.
I will... I promise.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
That wasn't me.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
Jack Gordon.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Not yet.
And what is that, sir?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
But if he knew we have so little time -
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Sometimes you do.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Maybe they'll catch up.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I didn't.
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
Then please - do this test for me.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
Killed outright?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Yes, Doctor. Please.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
All right, then tell me how -
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
What was it?
Yes...! They were screaming.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
You have my word. Paul?
Did you breast-feed her?
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
How did you learn English?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
No. I will find you.
And by sea!
Yes. Yes, I will.
I am sorry, Duncan...
Dark haired...
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
We don't.
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
And what is that?
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
The decision is final.
Atten-hut!
Yes sir!
Fire!
Gifts?
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Yes.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
Granted.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Be my guest.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
He did.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Can you fix it?
No.
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
What?
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Okay.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
I know that.
Do it.
Not yet.
Timex...
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
Itches like hell.
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
It's had a meal.
Like a leech.
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
The air's stopped.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Well, it's still a good idea.
Seven hundred for the pair.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
Well what?
Apart from those shotguns.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Just carrying a bag.
Sure is.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
Just hold on, I got the keys.
OK, open the gate.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
What do you mean?
What do you mean, me?
A hundred grand.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
I want your bar.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
Well, perhaps you can help?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
You know how much it is, Nick.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
I'll only be a minute.
Six.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
What do you mean?
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Leave your sister out of it.
I can't take any more school.
They're not going to jail.
I can fix cars.
You think I can't learn that?
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
I'm sorry, sir.
I am, sir.
The--the officers.
I do, sir.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
He'll live.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Yes, Sergeant.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
That badge--
Colt Peacemaker.
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
No sir.
That guy who got shot--
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
He's still pissed off about it.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Maybe.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Yeah?
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Pleased to meet you.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Protection?
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
We don't need a new jail.
Right.
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Do you?
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Steve?
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
A little older than Paloma is now.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
I don't mean Fernando.
I never said that.
You ever play one of these?
Not if I can help it.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Okay? He's not here?
He's going to wish he was dead.
And when my father was Sheriff?
He ever accept cash for a favor?
Of course you can.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I only went for my last two years.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
So I've heard--
Well, you were working there--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Most people did, yeah.
Yeah.
Amado.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Pilar--
I came back 'cause you were here.
Yeah.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
What was your father's name?
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Gotta be in person.
You'd do a good job.
I appreciate you telling me.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
What's up?
No--
Name's Otis.
I know that.
You believe that?
Thirty-five bucks.
Who is he?
doorway) And who's that?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Knew what?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
He won't.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
It was me.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Yes...
Yes.
Does that mean...?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Do you?
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Some or it.
And they all came...
It's okay.
You can't.
Harry...
Good.  There.  Yes?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
I just saw him.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
He got up and walked.
--vanished.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
I heard he was the best.
Fuck you.
I'm here to offer you a job.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Swann's wife.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Shut up!
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
A Mister Quaid?
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
He deserved it.
Didn't know you read minds.
And you believed him?
No.
You didn't try hard enough.
What?
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
Who's not?
No!
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
No.
Hi, Charlie.
I know. I don't either.
Ok, whatever you want.
No, I was looking at you.
You're possessive.
No, yes, it does...
Where'd you grow up?
They really have to work on that street name thing.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Working.
Yeah.
No.
A coke.
Around.
Tomorrow.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Yes, no.
Yes?
Hello, darling.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Why do you have to defend her?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I got some hair stuff.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
It'll just be a few days.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Do you think they have a room here?
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Sushi.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
When did they find her?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
My secretary?
I think I should join you.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
You heard voices, you know you did.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You ready?
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Miette, come here and relax.
How many weeks are you honey/
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Peter, please...
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
That's true.
Maybe that's my problem.
What are these?
And what's that mean?
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
We millionaires yet?
There weren't any voices.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
He's looking right at me.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
Nothing.
Nothing.  So good luck.
Need any help?
How is he?
To that stewardess?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
I don't remember that.
She's alright.
Camille, she'll be fine.
The blue.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
What?
Four days.
Why not?
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
I'll take that as a compliment.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Lucky.
Uh huh.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
For how long?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Your legs don't look broke.
Yeah.
That what you think?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
You do see me standing here, right?
Fine, Quincy.
I said fine.
Quit.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
She understands.
You're not stupid.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
What's up?
Nobody.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
What the hell's going on?
Cheap date.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
We won the championship.
Kiss my ass.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Getting there.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Business folks.
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
Nona, please.
Yup.
This is just about money, you know that.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
You know, people.
What mess?
We need to talk.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
No.
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Brain and Lung.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
Who was it?
Bit messy.
I don't have a boyfriend.
It's not -- what's a 422?
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
If you're not here for a 422 --
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
...yeah...
I'm sorry --
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
I'm sorry.
ok.
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
Ready to go,go,go?
Sure, why?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Son, please, now....
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
What happend?
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
This sounds threatening.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Yes.
Do you wanna sit down?
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
I'm trying.
She loves you.
-- memory?
Go fuck myself?
Is this 509-9027?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
-- let's talk more about your background --
Is that still lingering?
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
Go ahead and waste your time.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
He passed away.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Oh yeah.
Uh. huh.
I don't think, he can't...
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
No.
I didn't hear anything.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Yes.
Rose, I don't --
How long with Paula?
What about now?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
Maybe...I don't...
Did you ever touch her?
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
No.
What's MOW?
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
I'm trying to help, Linda --
Linda --
Hang up the phone.
Hi.
mmmhmm.
...I don't....
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
Should be one-thirty.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
Stand up.
....Why does he do it...?
It's not right.
Nothing... Nothing.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
How goes that favor I asked of you?
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
A body.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
You're a fool!
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
There are more important things than tits.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
No, not Louis!
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Well... Well... Okay.
Why didn't you say so?
He lures us to capture.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I know.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
Whose rooms are those?
How did you --
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Get out of my way.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
It's lovely.  It's just...
You would do that, your Majesty?
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Oh Louis, Louis...
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
So what?
You set to go -
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
I'll live...
And he took a swing at you?
Did he harm the girl?
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
He said he was following up some lead.
Seattle.
What happened with the tape?
No -
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
I killed them.
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Then what did you do, play canasta?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Could he handle a direct contact?
How are Molly and the boy?
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
There's no connection between the families.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
He had to.
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
In eight days.
I have work to do at the plant.
Francis? Where are you?
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
No!
Was I in an accident?
I don't know...
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
Yes.
Not me.
No.
No.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Uh... sure...
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
I don't think I'll tell you.
Cut the general crap.
Goodbye.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
I call him a monster.
What did he want?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Tell me about yourself.
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Blue, then.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
No.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Will? Are you okay?
I want to see you, too.
That's not true.
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Go on to the house.
Yes.
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
...after a while.
...yes.
Stuart is fine.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
I thought you would have some ideas.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Yes. I'd considered it.
I want your opinion.
What do you want?
Fight what?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Tank you veddy much.
No.  Caspiar.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Hi George!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
What's up?
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
If you want...
Okay.  You're probably right.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
I'll take my chances!!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
I used to think you were original.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
You all look the same to me.
I don't know... My computer...
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
An accident?!
You killed them.
He's going to pop!
The Matrix?  Yeah.
What happened to them?
Any time.
He's beginning to believe.
But what if...?
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
The agents --
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
What does that mean?
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
You've never used them before.
Because... I didn't think I would?
I think I do.
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Of the Resistance.
Yes.
That I would find the One.
That's why we're here.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Morpheus, I don't know --
I need the main wet-wall.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Shit, I'm sorry.
But what?
Gee-zus.
It's going into replication.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
That's different.
Are you worried?
No.
... right as rain.
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
It wasn't fast enough.
No.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
What are you talking about?
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Duck!
I can't!
Hurry, Neo.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
She don't look Jewish.
Yeah.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Wouldn't bother me.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Don't be smart.
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
No.
Good idea.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Fine.
That's nice.
Oh...around...why?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
What do they expect you to say?
Wha?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Here.
Well...
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Sal!... fourteen street.
Quiet please.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
You think so?
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Hi, Allison --
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Do they, m'dear?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
You mean this, sir?
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Then why did you bring it up?
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
A voice?
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
Me, too.
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
How nice for you both.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
No, no.  I on holiday.
Make it go 'way.
Make it time.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Hi, Jennifer.
Sure.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
As long as it takes.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
I didn't know that.
How did you meet?
But she loves you?
What do you mean 'free'?
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
No.
I haven't.
Do you love Drew?
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Not now.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I said get out.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Where are you going?
We know all that we need to know --
'Threw' you?  Where?
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
No.
I won't.
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
Yes?
What do you mean?
Yes, Bill.
Not this.
Can you keep a secret?
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
I don't know.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
I told you, 'watch it'.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
'...Yes --'
Death!
Then don't.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
What you were talking about.
I think you know --
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
Does Drew tell you everything?
...Then don't.
So what's wrong with that?
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Nothing.
Will it?...
Raise away.
It's something.
What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
The fireworks are about to start.
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
So you're a one-girl guy?
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
No --
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's it.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I'm sorry... um... ?
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
As requested.
This isn't my room?
Why?
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Just two. So far.							  *
Yeah?
Strip!
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Yes.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Where is he?
Calls himself Dodd.
No!
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Did Teddy send you?
I enjoy it.
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
You said you were leaving town.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
I'll ride with him. You follow.
What's wrong with this one?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
Sammy didn't have a wife.
Somehow, I'll know!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
Doing...?
What's your twenty?
Grieve elsewhere.
"And" what?
Good.
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Tell them what you want.
25% discount on the load.
Died in childbirth, having me...
That's right.
Exactly.
Cost less.  That's the point.
What do you mean?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Do I need it?
Really?
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
No.
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
Five minutes...
Nothing.
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Bored.
Not French registry?
You set this up!
Do we need this...?
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
You sure are a pretty lady.
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
For money for what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
Don't need a comb.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
What?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
You bet I do, sir.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Get down -- where?
... and taxi fare for me.
Is he all right!
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Sure.
About ten kilometers.
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Something like that. Cigarette?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
What did he do?
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
He wasn't even in the car?
Hello.
What do you mean?
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Cut his fucking throat.
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
Yeah? Where?
What?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
You can't take anything seriously.
What is it? . . . Billy?
Mr. Yesil.
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
New York's finest.
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
I pull.
Nino, please...
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Don't get kinky here...
Maybe they lied to you.
I heard how you talked to him.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
The scent won't last...
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Jump in.
That's it?
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Sure.
Following me?
I don't have a title yet.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
It has no nobility.
It's fine.
The phones are working?
My daughter must be going nuts.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
The Sistine Chapel?
I know how that can be.
Yeah, thanks.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
C'mere, I'll show you.
I'm telling you, I can't.
The what?
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
Yeah, yeah...
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
To Misery.
No, I haven't.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Be my guest.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
I'm glad you like it.
It will.
You don't know?
I'm almost done.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Oh, I like that tone.
What thing?
What is it?
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
No, the typing kind.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
From her point of view or mine?
Sean, please..
Hugh, I'm impressed..
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Well that depends.
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
How much longer before you can reach him?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Uh-huh?
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Damn, you're beautiful.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
Affirmative.
Ethan, tell me -
Oh Ethan!..
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
She must still be on the property.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
Do I?
By asking me.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
S.O.P..
I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
Always.
Krieger.
Roger that.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
What happened to Jim?
You didn't have to.........
This stuff is so sticky.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Theyíre dead.
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
Where exactly is it?
Just don't chew it.
I didn't touch it.
Give me a break, Pops.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
Jim we canít.
Why?
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Very well.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
I remember..
Yeah.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
And get a doctor.
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
Keep counting Claire.
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
Of course I can hear you.
Loud and clear.
Jack...that's spying.
Jack you're so wicked.
And a lonely ass.
Twenty minutes.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
What's your news?
I won't come.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Let's go tell your Mother.
What are you doing here?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Hurry up.
I don't understand.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
I'm making you a steak.
Instantaneous.
Stupid.
A wolf without a foot!
Take it easy.
I can't do that!
I'll come to the wedding.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Awful?
I think that's it.
How can you ask me that?
I know what I know.
That's right.
Yeah.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
I don't understand.
We should talk alone.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
Where's the ring?
No.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Everything's different.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
What sins have you to confess?
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Definitely!
Will you join me for dinner?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Don't shit where you eat.
I'm a housewife.
I'm too old for you.
My God, it's a mansion!
Marriage is happy news.
What? What?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
You see that moon last night?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
I am your king!
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
One that looks nice.
So be it!
'Tis but a scratch.
I've had worse.
Had enough?
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
You'll what ... ?
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Just keep me covered.
Oh, just some friends!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
There.
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Bloody peasant! 
I'm not dead!
Do me a favour.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
What is your name, handsome knight?
No, It's nothing!
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
No.  It's unhealthy.
Back to your bed!  At once!
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
Look.  I'm warning you.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
I didn't.
Not down south you don't.
Seventy a year.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
You know what I mean.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
The good-looking one.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
I'm getting dressed.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
You know nothing about her!
Get out.  Out!
Louder, girl!
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Of course.
A situation?
I'm flattered you think so.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Whom you address.
And that is my last word on the matter.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
My own.
Back and upper corridors.
How will I know?
Aye, do.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
I don't think about it.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Why?
I do what I do.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
She trusts you, John.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Archie.
Yes, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Are they worth reading?
That doesn't make him an expert.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes?
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
So?
To know when he'll be king.
Who?
No, she wasn't.
Yes.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
I understand he was in a fight.
A few days, ma'am.
No.  I shall be out walking.
What is it?
He is sick, ma'am.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
What's the question mark?
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
We are talking...
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
You imagined it.
No way.
She thought Benz was at school.
It's already out.
And beat it at it's own game.
I can't believe you made it!
You didn't hear me?
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
We're actually inside, aren't we?
One.  In case...
Got it.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
I know.
Then we'll go home.
That's impossible.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
The game will guide you.
Sign me up.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
The Cowboy??
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
You're an understandin' fella.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I told ya.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Very pleased to meet you.
But you won't.
Yes, there was.
Oh...
But, this could be serious.
What do you mean?
Mulholland Drive?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
We'll take our check.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"Before what?"
"Then they'd put you in jail."
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
I just wanted to come here.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Yeah.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Interesting.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
I'm leaving.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
We drown.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
That's a shame.
Because of my charming personality ?
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Look...
That's cute asshole.
Ow...
What ? Are you my mother ?
I said NO.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I just want to double check the facts.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
I am thirty two.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Sir ?
John, sir.
Better, sir.
Sir ?
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
I'm listening.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
You're paying the bills.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
What happened ?
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Zach from work ?
I'm fine.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I would do it again in a minute.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Her favorite poet.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
How about a nice glass of milk?
Does she?
I'll try.
I've got something better.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
It's just a corpse.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
Then I have come to the right place.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
My mother.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Give it back Nicholas!
I won't.
You're over reacting!
Yeah, RIGHT.
TAXI!!!
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What if you don't wanna be found?
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Leave me alone!!
Big deal.
What do you think?
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Nick?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
Part adventure...part miracle.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Yes, it does.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Phil for God sake.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Is that a yes?
Not exactly.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Yes, I do.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Good for you baby.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
I'm impressed.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Yes.
Deceased.
It's no big deal.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
In ages, I know, me neither.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
You can get the general idea...
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Sorry.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
He was allergic to bees.
What??
No, no.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
I'm very nervous.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Are you sure about all this?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Thank you. Bye.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Thirty five dollars.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
For this class?
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
We'd love to hear it.
Do you think she is?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
Can we look around in your camper?
Uh huh.
Mostly love, and romance.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
I will I promise.
Liverpool?
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Hey, where does it say that?
Yes.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
But I have my clothes on!
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
Not true.
Umm, Ummmmm
Part of being a New Yorker.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
You have a real philosophy of life.
You've been working on this, huh?
The man you love.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
It's too late to start over.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
And what will he do?
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
Can you watch the road?
Which was the disqualifying factor?
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
Let me rephrase that...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
Gold nose hair clippers.
Exactly.
Only.  If he wants to.
That's entirely understandable.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
I know Ben.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Well, somet...
What's next?
Quite the little eccentric.
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
Boy, those were the days.
Michael!!
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
If you like.
You've been the man in mine.
Me either.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
... maybe it's congratulations.
A bad combination.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
Well, it happens.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
If you find her...
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
Like family, huh?
Well, if that's the way you f...
An so it is.
You're much more his type.
You got a real good memory, Star.
I see.
You'll have to speak up.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Okay. Thanks.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
What does he want?
Okay.
President.
It's the den mother.
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll just be in here.
What is a turkey shoot.
Sure he will.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Can I help you?
She sure sings nice.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Well, he's really amazing.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Sixty-three.
Oh... Well.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Does their hair fall out?
Bye.
It just is.
About three years.
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
I have to go.
I can't.
I'm not sure.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Linnea?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
How much?
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
For him?
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Might be good for you.
What!
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Oh?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Do you study at all?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Why?
Where is she?
He ain't really new.
You bet.
You think I got any kind of a voice?
Yes, you are.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Are we in a big hurry?
Yeah.
Don't stop!
You been followin' the news coverage?
Susanville, Soledade.
By all means.
What?
She was born without a tongue.
What?
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
She sings? What does she sing?
All right, Mickey.
Aside from the obvious?
Do you miss Mallory?
Then was it worth it?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
Sure.
Yeah, we have a van.
Yes.
So, what now?
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
Unfortunately, yes.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
They've hypnotized the nation.
Survival of the fittest.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Wayne Gayle.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Slate it.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
They're mesmerising.
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Really?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Don't call my men assholes.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
You think so, Frankie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
No. You got the wrong idea.
What d'you think?
Don't start no trouble, boy!
Where's Wilma?
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Okay.
Where's he at?
Thanks.
Guess I don't.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Okay, thanks very much.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
How d'you mean?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
No thanks.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
Oh yeah, and then what?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Why did you?
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Yeah?
He could live with us.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
We'll be all right.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
What the hell could you do?
Take it easy, Frankie.
How 'bout the key?
Like what?
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
What's on your mind?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
I heard you.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
I said, she's in great shape.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
No, they won't.
I doubt it.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
I understand.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Omar, listen to me--
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Since when?
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
The Elders, mon...
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
How's the villa's security?
Why not?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
It hasn't yet.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
Can you read my mind?
Are you even really alive?
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
You're pleasant tonight.
Yeah.
It's Case. Remember me?
Yeah. That was me.
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Jah guides us.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
Can you take me to it?
We run. You crack the pattern?
It's coming.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
So you're a wire junkie.
Too late?
Won't that mean you're dead?
Case...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
They'll cut you down.
Something exotic I hope.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
You're out of time, man.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
What are you talking about?
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Yeah. Let's do that.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Yes, it's lame.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
YOU KNIT?
Leave.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.

Hidden camera.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Betty.
Five-- Six--
A flack jacket.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Oh. Right.
Have you been to any parties?
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Do you remember high school?
I can't do this.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
No. Josie, this is real.
Thanks. And what are -
Oh I don't think so.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
I know.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Well, are you here with anybody?
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
You were attracted to me?
But now you don't have to--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
What?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Nah uh.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Maybe we should sit.
We went through the door...
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Where?
No!
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Good.  I'm hungry.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
Just out for a while.
Ken!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Yeah, why?
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
I'll get over it.
Ghostbusters are fearless.
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
I'm not hungry.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
No.  I'm okay.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Can't it wait till morning?
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
How do we find him, Kristen?
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
So?
What?
I don't do that shit.
Fuck off.
A little basic, but nice.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Thanks, Max.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Call me Nancy.
Didn't get much sleep.
All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
So do I.
Doesn't matter.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
How do we get in?
A sad choice.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
Cooling down.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
Uh, fourteen.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Now you're lying.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Fifteen million dollars.
Fine.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
No thanks.
No.
No.
Thanks.  Well...
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Hello.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Let's go in.
She left me.
You've got to go.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
No.  What's that?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
Undressed like this, yes.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
Okay.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
And what would you say...
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
What's your name?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Right. 
Yes, I think that one may be.
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
What's your name?
The others?
This is Henry James film?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
No, don't think I do.
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
No, no.  She doesn't.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Hi...
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
So -- any messages?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
No, 'fraid not.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
No -- you're right.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
I-I-I...
Mister Washington.
Will you come with me, please.
Sorry, ma'am.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
What for?
Right!
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
H-Hey, M-Mack.
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
No.
Are they all crazies?
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
Where ya goin', Mac?
They went that way.
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Me, too...
Me too...
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
What for?
Lobotomy?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
With your own two hands?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
I refuse!
No!
What's this?
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Me too! Me too!
In what way?
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
We'll let you know.
Time out!
Time out!
Are you a doctor?
Because I quit breathing.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Okay. How you doing?
To help you relax... please...
No...
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
Hi.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Big man!
I don't have any.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
What's that?
That!
Is he one of the loonies?
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Oh, yeah...
No, she wasn't my sister.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
No.
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
You're sure...
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Who's this?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
What?
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Mickey Spillane?
NO.
What are you doing here?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
In that case... no...
GET OUT!!
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Beautiful place...
Really?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
What?
No.  He smokes.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Is he married?
So?...
No.  He's never asked me.
I know.  You're right.
You don't have a passport.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
Are you sure?
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Nothing.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Hi.  Where've you been?
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
I know, but...
...and a fortune teller.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
My God... you're right.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Oh.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She didn't give me a chance.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Thanks.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
Sure we keep records!
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
In a minute.
It's a living.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Boss loader!
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Don't say that!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Which side are you with?
I'll get home all right now.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Man, you were a mess!
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
I don't know.
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
What I did to Joey.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Get out of my way.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Someone else c'n take your confession.
What are you going to do?
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to—
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
What about it?
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under—  — whop-whop!
You'll work.
I told you lay off.
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Easy. Easy, boy.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
How'd you get that.
You want to know somethin'—?
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
What do you mean?
I was only talkin' to her.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
One of these days.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Okay.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Don't let them hear you.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
A situation easily remedied.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
Ahh, she will be yours.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Ahh, there is yet time.
Well then let us proceed.
Is there time?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Yes, it is.
I know a Glenn.
No, thanks.
He'd call every once in a while.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Yes.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Uh-huh...
Now you're talkin'.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Forty-five minutes.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
I don't know.
I don't ski.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
And then they'll kill 'em.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
In the trunk, yeah?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
They're in 7D.
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
There a problem, Foley?
That's right.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
I thought everything.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
If I could have a little more room.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
In my bag, in the car.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Bleeding on a country road.
Really.
You won't do that.
Because you're having too much fun.
I don't have a problem with it.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I don't think we should get into that.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
Okay.  How many going out?
Must be a real soft pillow.
Any time.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
You gonna write me a check?
I'm not leaving Midge.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
I'm freezing my ass off.
Gimme another hint.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
Can I do what?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
You not with probation, one of those?
You a lawyer?
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I'd like that.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
I told you, he isn't here.
That's right, just me.
No.  Course not.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
Are they dead?
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
Sir?
Hale-what?
Sir, I --
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
The Colonel helped me work it out.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Fuck you.
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Our doctor's gone too.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
You too, 'Mam.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
How did you?...
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
Good—bye, Grandma.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Peggy Sue!
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
That loud—mouthed little bitch~
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I know. Put Scott through college.
I call this the staccato. 
Maybe I blocked it out.
They'll learn to live with it.
Thanks.
Good.
Is this slow enough for you?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Save it.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
How'd you know about that?
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
I'm trying.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Of course.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
What're you doing here anyway?
Don't you get along with your parents?
I hate chickens.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Can we split now?
Evelyn, put her to bed.
At my age? Don't be silly.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Oh. I forgot.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
What's that?
I	know what a burrito is.
What's inside?
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
I don't know.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Wbat're you talking about?
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Pretty much so.
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
Sure.
I'll be fine, Dad.
You alright?
I'm going out, Dad!
Is he gonna be okay?
He pissed me off.
What did?
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Yeah...
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
K-R-O-one.
Because they deserve to, Walter.
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
I said, don't worry about it.
I am relaxed.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
I promise!
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
Don't do this, Andy.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Little baby girl.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
What's her name?
We're friends of Beckett's.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Let's find you a drink.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Sure. It's fine.
Uh huh...
What kind of person is that?
Sure thing.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
Something like that.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
I'm fine.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Yes.
What did you say?
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Uh.... No. Not really.
We were satisfied.
That's correct.
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Okay, Joe...
That's perfectly clear.
Yeah... ?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
How did you do that?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
You had one guy "like that?"
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Saw something I didn't like.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
But they...they could still be....
I would try for them.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Like the light is scalding it.
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Probably right.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
How many?
Let's wait on the power cells.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
For your own fear.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
What?
Which half?
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Oh, so I'm disposable?
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
About the girl.
Not if I'm the one.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
So which one caught your eye?
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Do you have any weapons?
Just the same, I want one.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
What's so special about him?
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
The evidence was very meager --
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
That way.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Sustained.
Show this to the President.
What signal?
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I'm for that.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
I think you're making a mistake.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
The Hunt Club.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Mind your tongue, madame.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
Then you admit --
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Taylor, you can't.
Why not?
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
This is his assertion.
He doesn't know.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
How the hell did he get away?
Says he can't walk.
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Fuck you bitch.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Shaddup bitch.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
What?
Barnes comes from Hell.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
Where's Elias come from?
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
No!
Yeah.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
These two holes are yours...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
Well..
Yes?
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
How do you do?
How careful should I be?
How long would that take?
I see.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Bad enough.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
They know you here--know your name.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Couldn't be.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
No percentage in that.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
They'll look for you.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Killaine...
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
A graduation present.
I've never been to Florida.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
I don't want to talk.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
Because you think your in love with me?
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
I know that.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
We know everything.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
Morning. Any calls?
You mentioned information.
A thousand.
Why not here?
Leave that one lay.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
Round of golf Saturday?
Hardly. Who's the girl?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
That must hurt.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Floater?
Let me know when you've identified him
Go live in a tent.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Should be over there.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
So?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Why should I mind?
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
Yes.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
I'm not sure I can face it.
I see.
Yes, please.
Freshman and sophomores...
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
I think it went on rather too long.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
The Argies.
Come on.  Hand over.
Let me see.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Ha ha...
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Why not sit down and wait?
Dad.
Now listen...
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
De nada.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
A flaw I'm working on.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
You first!
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
I take the skin off chicken.
Zero distortion, sir.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
That's the point, isn't it?
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Okay, Dad.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Did he rob it?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Shrimp and fries.
I need you to teach me.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Warm them up.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
Anytime.
I'll take him.
I think it's Hawkins.
He knows our defenses.
Twenty-five percent.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
What?
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
Yes.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
The price just went up to ten.
You're not from L.A., huh?
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
What?
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Can I have some chips?
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Oooh, thank god.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
What are assets?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
What happened to him?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
Did you?
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
It was good.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
My what?
Afternoon.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
We're letting them slide?
But, Edward...
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
Yes...
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Was that you?
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Do I!?  Momma!
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
But what if they serve soup?
Miss Vivian.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Then I'm here till I die?
So it's to be torture.
Of course.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
Of course you will.
I will never doubt again.
Did you say, "I do"?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
Veer left. Left. Left!
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
What do I do?
Yes, some of the time. 
-- what? --
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Where did you get that?
Right, right, sorry.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
As you wish...
Sire.
DEATH FIRST!!
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
He's already dead.
Hah?
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Again. Thank you.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Get used to disappointment.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Oh, have it your way.
I smell nothing.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Australia.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
A little bit.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Ooooooops.
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Where?  What?
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
You found a flop!
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
No way out.  No way out.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Yes.
No kidding?
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Very nice girl.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
I shall count the minutes.
What have you done, LSD?
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
We won.
No.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
Tell me all about her.
How early?
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
Back where?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
And the police haven't been able to...
Like what?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Sam.
Well?
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Of course we will.
This is the old highway.
Watch your tenses.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Hospital clean.
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Sam!
I've lost my girlish laughter.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
I haven't even been married once yet!
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
No.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
I'd like to, but...
Crane.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
Maybe you saw Mary!
At this hour?
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
I suppose you want a cabin.
Yes.
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
Maybe you want my money, too.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Maybe you're right.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
That's it. You get it quick.
Well, news of Buckley?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
How? What can I do?
A voice ...
Yes, the child ...
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
What do you think I am?
You mean he was colored?
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
No foolin' -- any suspect?
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Cry-baby?
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Good night, sir.
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You're insane.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Dad...
Excuse me???
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Is Rose here?
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Nobody.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
I don't want to know...
How did the rabbits kill him?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Well... maybe...
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
No.
She's watching the car again?
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Yeah.
Okay.
They're discussing it.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
Here comes Daddy.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Oh. Did you say something?
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
She will succeed.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Over... my... dead... body!
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Fine.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Mine.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Oh, yeah?
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Illusions, Madam?
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Yes, Ma'am.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Be quiet, Rose.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
You're not gonna see him again.
Incestuous.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
What?
Entertainers don't count.
They shot us all, kid.
It's not gonna happen.
Bullshit.
No, but it should.
It's go time, Billy-B.
I'm waiting till the time's right.
Nope.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
There'll be other chances.
You going rogue on me?
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Shit.  You're right.
No you're not.
Oh yeah?
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
I can't kill my own father.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Where am I?
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Lando!
You, too.
Good, I hate long waits.
All right, hang on.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
I will not fight you, father.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
It's just a..a party Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
No, don't do that.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
From Transexual Transylvania.
So come up to the Lab.
Like I'm outside in the rain
Free to try and find a game
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
...Fine.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
...I suppose.
Morning after?
Yeah...
...What?
I gotta go out for a while.
Apollo?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Don't say that.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
It's not your house --
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
You're hurtin', man!
...Still don't feel no heat.
Very high an' very fast.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Move your shoulders down.
No wine.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
...Ten minutes.
Charge it.
I agree.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Gonna try.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
...Thanks.
Sparrin'?
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Hey --
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
I won't.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
I said, how ya feelin'?
...Tomato?
...What?
Come July, twenty-five.
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Yeah, sure.
Message -- What message?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
Yo, Benny.
Would you keep goin'?
Great, kid, great.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
It ain't your locker no more.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Looks, huh?
Absolutely...
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Ice skate.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Maybe --
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
Shoulda guessed.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Toon cops worked me over.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
I don't work in Toontown.
As soon as is humanly possible.
No, I don't.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Ay me!
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Is she a Capulet?
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Do you really think so?
And then...
That's why you were riding with him.
It's been known to happen.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
You lose them!
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
Don't do it, Sam!
I think not.  After you...
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
You'll die if you leave here.
Now that is an interesting proposition.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
There is one other thing...
Not exactly.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
Call it a reckoning of character.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Not for long.
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
To see a man about a thing.
I do.
You were smoking?
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You don't have to do this.
You see the bullet?
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
Do what?
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
You think?
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Do you have a good answer?
I can't get enough of it.
Seven thousand...
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Why?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Torch it?!
What's that?
What are you gonna do?
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
There it is...now what about the others?
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Then we're screwed.
Hello.
He's irresponsible.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Are you sure you're OK?
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
You know I do.
This just might be our ticket!
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
We appreciate that.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Is this marked money, or what?
Hmmm...
Uh...C?
Sure.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Right behind you.
What?
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Yeah.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Absolutely positively.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
We're going to find out.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
How much is that?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
I don't think so...
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
Don't look at my ass!
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Who?
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Ask me if I give a shit.
I cannot go to LA...
You said --
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
You pull a muscle or something?
Excuse me?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What is it?
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
Shhh, my head hurts.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
No.
Who's Benjamin?
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
MMMMMM!!!!
I did!
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
No problem.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
It's okay, I got lots more.
This money is evidence.
Amen to that, brother.
Excuse me?
The Secret Service?  Why?
Thank you.
I'll take him.
The police can protect you.
Yes, Master.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
So was I.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
We are both full of shit.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Don't go there...
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
No, fish is a PM food.
I am from outa town.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Nobody touches me.
Do it!
What are you talking about?
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Ambassador Han.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
He's here!... He's here!
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
"Never say die."
His hair... any color.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
What?
No.  No, you didn't.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
I don't know.
Then come for dinner.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
No, I'm not.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Originality is my speciality.
You'll answer my questions?
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
You afraid to try?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
I kissed him back.
Well, you do have the dress.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
She's the boss.
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Where?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Why?
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Thank you, Dad.
No.  It's my life.
Yeah.
It sounds nice.
-- who's married to --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
They're going to love you.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
That doesn't make any sense.
And then I'll see you in New York --
What?
It was my mother's.
So what happened?
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I know.
Turn on your radio!
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
Come on, Jonah --
Any time.
We'll move them --
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
It's a sign.
Grace heard it.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
It's not that late in Seattle.
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
Yeah.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Right, right.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
I don't get it.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I don't know.  Do I?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Whose show was this on?
Go to sleep.
What was?
Good.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
It's only ten o'clock.
Was Mom an adjustment?
Victoria? She's okay.
Are you going with her?
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Well...
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
What do you mean?
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
That's none of their affair.
Whose side are you on anyway?
I don't make policy.
An American.
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Antonio paid for it.
What makes you so sure?
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Hunting.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
You should have helped her without being asked.
That's it?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
The spiders.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
How about in the house?
Did you see his hair color?
Everything go?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Why not?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
How?
What happened to your eye?
And you admire that?
I try.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
What is wrong with you?
Please open the door, Danny.
Find a new job.
They would have killed you too.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
I think on account of his nose.
No. I'm good.
Yes, Jimmy
Wait till I tell you what it is.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Hey, check it out...
Good for you Jimmy.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Big Bill.
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
Yeah.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Question is, what are you doing here?
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Jesus.
What's he holding?
To who?
What?!
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
There's no motels around here.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Why are you doing this?
Don't we always take good care of you?
Now that's scary!
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
In West Fork?
You must be a hell a shot.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Nope, he ain't Wade.
What deal?
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
A half-track, anything.
It was nothing.
Pass.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
You know classical music?
A machine gun.
Same place we are.
Sure, you got one?
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
I've got a line on one.
PUSH!
That's not what we're here for.
Nope.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Yes, sir.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
You have orders, too.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
But we accomplish the mission.
That's a mystery to me.
Have it your way, Captain.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
HERE THEY COME!
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Alright, come with me.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
What about you, Captain?
Twenty-four-five.
Understanding the following rights...
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Good for her.
Excellent.
I'm gonna call her.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Meaning?
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
I love you dad.
I'm fine.
You're going.
Yes, I...
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
You're right.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Alright.
Look at those eyes.
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
No.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Bye.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Okay.
Yeah?
Right.
Am I wrecking my car?
You're shaking.
It was wonderful.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What's wrong?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
No, I don't, I don't.
No.
Just my dad.
I'm sorry.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
No.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
Your car?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Hey.
I called her up.
How you doin', brother?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Alright!
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Klaus Tauber.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
War.
Good.
I pay you too much.
What's going on?
Look -
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Of course I'm on it.
That's great.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
The war could end.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
They arrived, can you believe it?
You did so much.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
On national television.
Where?
That's smart.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
That's okay.
Why aren't you there?
What if I said you?
No, it's me.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
Did it?
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
And much richer as a result.
Home--where he lives.
Why don't you ask them?
Finish what my son started.
What's your subject?
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Sid, you don't have to.
The forbidden subject.
I think it's out of your control.
No, it's not.
Good question. You took the bait.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
Or it found us.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
What are we looking for?
And Joel's pre-med.
Over here.
No, wait here.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Dewey, there's no such place.
You're pretty when you're angry.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Is Sid in therapy?
What?
Hello?  Hello?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
I'd really just like to be alone.
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
I counted four.
Easy black boy.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
Closer than you think.
But...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Thanks.
Good bye Ben.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
There's more.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
What does this have to do with Sid?
The killer called her.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
And who is that?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
Need to get in that building?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
I'm hanging up right now.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
No one's saying you did.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
You know it.
Oh yeah.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
She looked dead. Still does.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Yes, sir.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
You lost your mom...
Oh Sidney...
It's okay. Give me the gun.
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Stop it!
Are you alone in the house?
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Really? What?
To talk.
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
Or else what?
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
I believe you...
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Guess.
That all depends on you.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
NOOOO....
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
What?
Your call.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Can I bring Kenny?
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
...yeah...
And my Dad? Any word on him?
How is she?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Yes, sir.
Forget it.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Why would she lie about it?
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
So who are you?
Twice.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
I can cry on cue.
He came to make up.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Are you serious?
Why are you doing this?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just like old times, ain't it?
It's alright. I'll get it.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
Come on, let's rock.
Oh, god...
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
For once, Stu, drop it.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
Tits -- see.
So what?  This victim...
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
No, I haven't heard.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
I read about it in the paper.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Why?
Her pretty head.
NO!
You'll see.
Sit back.
It's close.
What the fuck is going on?
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
For now.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
Can we talk about this in private?
What?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
It's got to be.
Bear with me.
Just wait!
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
And so what?
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
We had him.
Then, he must write about these murders.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You do your job...
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
That part of me is dead.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
I... I don't understand.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
It surprises me.  It really does.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
He mentioned it.
Did the wife confess?
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
By what you preach...none!
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Good night...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
What's that?
Think it might be...?
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Nine...  Ten!
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
It's what I'm countin' on.
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
No...not yet...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
I just had a really strange experience.
What?
So do I, believe me.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
What are you talking about-
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
1976.  What happened back then?
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Ten pounds.
Done.
yet cannot love nor write it.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Oh, that.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Every word.
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Who wrote that?
Fifty pounds? What for?
I did not.
Tomorrow
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
What? Who?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
I am not so well-born.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Your Majesty.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
I have lost my gift.
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Ay me."
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Is she obedient?
I like her.
Oh--I am him too!
Oh
Well perhaps better than my first. 
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
You cannot marry Wessex!
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
The Queen has consented?
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Do you understand me?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
Serve.
I don't have time.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
Is this necessary?
I don't know.
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
We just wanted to speak to you.
Cover it?
Take another look at these two.
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
For the flat.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
What I am.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Open it.
What? What's wrong?
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
That's not him.
Then let's spend some money.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
What are you doing here?
Forget it.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
You mean I can have the room?
Yeah.
Burglary?
Of course.
did you hear anything before he cries?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Did you ever kill a man?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Yes. They're my friends.
I'm sorry.
What?
No one. I promise.
It wasn't like that.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
That one, last week.
I'd be delighted.
A priest who dies.
You know about it?
And that's not the same thing?
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
What do you expect me to do about it?
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
No.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
I hope she's all right.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Hello, George.
Right now, I just don't care.
Nobody can hear it.
Uh-uh.
No.
I guess so.
I guess so.
Okay.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Am I what?
I never get my hair done.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
I am not like my mother!
Right.
They are?
I've got heads here, Norman.
He's a very private person, actually.
Probably the bathroom.
I'd cut it...
Do you? You still see him?
Why not?
You did, didn't you?
You don't do that anymore, do you?
-- we can't now.
No you didn't.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Don't go, Jackie...
No, man.
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
-- Oh my yes.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
What's gonna happen?
What?
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Okay.
About what?
Your advice!
Who?
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
I'm very tired, George.
Oh, Christ.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
How many?
I just want to know, that's all.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
That's all you've got to say?
What did you say?
No?
In a way. But...
Sure.
Oh yeah?
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
Oh, hey...
-- yeah?
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Well, what?
Now wait a minute...
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
No thanks.
Okay, thanks.
I know.
Oh yeah...
What about her?
What?
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
That's not very logical, Lester.
Fine.
Aren't you going to have one?
See you later.
Who is that?
Don't be silly.
Honey?
-- sort of a boyfriend?
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
-- never mind.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Well... sure...
I don't think so.
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Of course not.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
-- just wonderful.
No.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
Yes, Dad.
Do you feel bad?
What do you mean?
Yes, Dad.
How does he tell you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Yeah.
No.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
I won't, Mom.
Okay, Mom.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Oh!
No.
Why not?
Where does he go?
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
I'm a Wendy.
What line of work are you in now?
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Uh...huh.
Yeah.
What time is it?
Hmm, nice.
Yes.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Wendy...
Well...
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Eight thirty.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Let me help you up.
Will you?
Jane-
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
For getting a divorce?
What?
Yeah.
Yeah! What is it?
Yeah, I know. It's great!
What the hell does that matter?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I told you!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Really?
What about crack?  You a user?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
And you listen to that?
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Yes?
Good evening, Vincent.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Chops?
Enough jabber.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Mary Robert.
Amateurs 2
What?
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
She won't?  Why not?
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
Experience!
Give me a C.  A C!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Very well.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
What?
Can do.
Like to who?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
Your cell is more than adequate.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
No.  No.
Out of the question.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
He didn't do you a favor.
Get a stenographer.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Even nuns have to pee.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
It didn't work, Vince.
Maybe pants.
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
It's better than ice cream.
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Yes?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Many have.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
What are you spying on?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What of it?
Does that look like an animal hanging?
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Hmm?  See them?
Master Hardenbrook...
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
The Western Woods.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Are you so superstitious?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
You made this, and the drawings?
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
They have done nothing of the sort.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
It was not butchery.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
What troubles you?
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What?
No, but... why do you ask that?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
The skull is gone.
Come with me.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
His horse.
No.  She has gone out.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
What... ?
Yes.  Here...
Doctor, he is awake.
I can't remember.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
How are you, Bill?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
Give me the big'uns.
They was a boy. We made friends.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
What?
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Don't tell me what to do.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
I hate you!
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Two people.
I thought they was.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
Yeah.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
If you want me to.
He ain't no count.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Okay.
I'm glad of it, honey.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Did Vaughan go home?
Did Karl go to bed?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
I reckon.
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
Yeah.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
No ma'am.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
What's that you say?
Not really to speak of.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Oh. How about before that?
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Yes sir.
Before they were married?
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
It's my birthday.
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
You what?
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
What is this, some kind of joke?
And why the hell would you give me money?
What difference does it make?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
And how much are these?
And these?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
And his parents?
Jesus.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Not a one.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
Well what?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
You can't be more specific than that?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
What time is it?
How long have you been here?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
You don't really want to know.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
What time did you get to bed last night?
The inspiration.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Here, catch.
Yeah, I picked it up.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
That's it. In a nutshell.
It wasn't my fault.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Yes, please.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
That's obvious.
You don't.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
You're implying th...
I did.  But the jury won't s...
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
...but he found you.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
And the next one...?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Tht was summation, Your H...
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Twelve.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Carl Heine came.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
I have told the truth.
Yes.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
The knife.  What knife?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
I was checking the cables.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
He had no reason to.
All right, girls - from the top again.
Funny?  In what way?
Thank you ever so.
Fresh!
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
Those two musicians from the garage!
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
No we're not.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Polish?
Down, Daphne!
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
You - you -
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
He's going to be ashore with you.
That's right.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Security.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Like what?
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Shut up and keep packing.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Get me Room 414.
I may throw up.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
I'll say.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
I'm fine.
Half-full.
I'm just going to get some ice.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
Come on, Daphne.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
The Florida job?
- you got to be blonde -
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
I am Cinderella the Second.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Bull fiddle.
Goodbye?
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Yes, Osgood?
Flower girl.
We won't breathe a word.
Oh, no!
What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
You got to be under twenty-five -
We'll take it!
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
My fault.
Who are you?
Not at all.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
You're society girls?
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
They repealed Prohibition?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Thanks just the same.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
All right - if you insist.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
From a rich millionaire.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
I know.  Every time!
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Booze.
Go where?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
You and who else?
Goodbye, Charlie.
What for?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Are you sure you’re okay?
Still--
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Mom, please.
Um, just about everyone.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
And you do now?
What?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
Kat.
You’re too good for him.
Why?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
I think that’s disgusting.
Shampoo, got it!
First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
I disappear. It’s not about me.
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Desperation?
Yeah.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Hi, kiddo.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Is there any other way to take it?
At least somebody’s using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
Will do.
Is he here in Borderdale?
That's right--
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
What do that mean?
Here, put my jacket over you.
It was too dark, Daddy.
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Where was you, Daddy?
Mornin', Daddy...
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
My father taught me...
I don't look like no possum!
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
David, come back here!
Listen, Mama...
Good night...
Yes, mam...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I'm used to it.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Montana.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
I said -
Very funny!
I saw him last night!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
YOU DO?!
Whoops.
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
Eric?
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
It's... It's not good children.
Oh no, it's that kid.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
FREEZE!!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
I don't know, dude.
Yeah, they suck.
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Yeah, so what do we say?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Are you sure, Kenny?
What is 'fisting'?
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Right away, ma'am!
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
I am.
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
I know.
You don't care.
Hey, relax guy!
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Anna...
Of course, of course...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Taylor, you surprise me.
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
I know, I know.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
Will you shut up already?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
So we did.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Sure.
Helllp!
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
What?  What are you talking about?
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
You too.
Hopefully sooner than later.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Nope.
Can I get you something for the road?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
When you get a chance.
Are you guys bruddas?
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
It was a clearance.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
I'd buy it!
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
Theo.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
That game was before you was born.
Grace Skinner.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
What's it look like to you?
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
You got a better offer?
He says that to all his wives.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Who's there?
Junior who?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
No!
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
He's my father, Millie.
Where can I find him?
Whips...orange whips.
Mine, and they never tip.
Won't your father help you with that?
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
No, not at all.
We'll get into that later.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Well, that was plan A.
Sheila, please.
What's plan C?
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
He's my father.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
Did you - kill him?
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
Are you sure he's dead?
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
I can't...
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Two and a half days?
Yeah.  I heard you.
But she's --
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
He's right beneath us.
That's our reserve air.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
They didn't tell me anything.
A thousand feet.
-- Wait a second --
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
What's wrong with oxygen?
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
She should've known better.
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Jerry?
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
They're coming.
Well, where the fuck is he?
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
It's not ignorant.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
Radiation shield, you think?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Sir, about leaving --
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Underwater?
It never occurred to me.
The timing has never seemed quite right.
What -- are you threatening me?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
Beth --
Beth.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
You went through Edmunds' things?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Beth --
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
In case you die, too?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
We must've had it delivered then.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Manifested?
You think, in the sphere --
But how?
How can the sphere do that?
But why is he doing it?
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Something for burns.
Bingo.
You want to kill him?
Where are you?
You think I'd really drink that?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
You tell me.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
C'mon -- what?
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
Is it?
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Leave me alone, Norman.
Beth --
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
It doesn't make any sense.
By the bunks.
For whoever's in that thing.
You'd have to ask them.
It's an American spacecraft.
I never said that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
I'm not being defensive.
Whatever I can do to help.
Am I?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
Page 87 of what, Harry?
But why would she -- ?
Wisconsin?
You know what it is, Harry.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Meaning?
Please.  It must have flown here --
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
Thank you.
The others, sir?
What report?
Told me what?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
He's a pussy.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Not that I know of.  Why?
You seen my suitcase?
Four.  Four years --
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
This isn't a game, you know.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
Is that good or bad?
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Could I learn to feel it?
What do you mean?
He's bluffing...
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
What are you saying?
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Why didn't you say so before.
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
He was our teacher... He was great.
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
I'm getting better.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
They revoke our flight status.
You and me, huh ?
So who's got time to get married ?
A funeral.
I don't know, Zander.
Excuse me...!
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
How do I know if this is love ?
I'll meet you outside.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Shhh...
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Sure.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
I won't quit !
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
No, sir.
Aw, don't get mushy.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
Not a problem.
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir !
Cover us, Ace !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
That is how V'ger will survive.
By the Creator.
Departure angle.
May I ask Why?
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Mr Decker....
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Sit down, please.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
And whatever you sensed out here....
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
The point... 
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Tractor beam remains constant...
I'll be there.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
I beg your pardon?
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
Yes...
Goodbye.
...I always thought so...
Yes...
You're still here.
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
I thought you had Play Practice.
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
You got a paperclip?
Paperclip?
Better idea...
"Room Service!"
Oh, God...
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
...take <u>any</u> two people...
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
I'd love to.
You know what else a man can do?
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Yes, that's right.
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Where have you been...
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Courthouse back in town.
Hi.
They know what her tits look like.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
That Could Be.
She wasn't in the...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
I <u>know</u> my lines...
I swear that that woman in my room...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
We've got three days to...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
Joe, the writer?
You mind...?
I think he's moved...
Who is it raped you?
Then what is the...?
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yeah.
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
I'm only trying to...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Marty...
I can't tell.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
This young woman.
No.  No, but we're planning to.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I know you do.
Why?
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
Like dykes and dogs.
Find the money.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
...not the Lazyboy...
And we're glad to have you here...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
...why do you think?
Secret's safe with me.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
Great.
Not with my mouth open.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
This is my daddy's house --
And this is my room so get out!
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
That doesn't bother me.
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
I knew where I was all the time.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Where are you, anyway?
Yes.
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Pray.  We never find out.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Oh.
You dying.
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
I'm worried.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
We're going to win this.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
Look, I...
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Not personally.
Anxiety.
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
...it's my problem, too.
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
You mean, after I'm dead?
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
And her...?
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You weren't passing 'em out.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
That's not us.
What?
Oh, yeah?
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Hey. What's up?
What?
Oh.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Four brothers and five sisters.
No.
We had to work. My family was poor.
I'm always working.
No.
He wasn't.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
Yes, I do. I love them!
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Yes, Mikey?
Got a lot of homework?
How was the class?
You mean, again?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Just the same.
Yeah?
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
No.
Say, Ni...
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Toby Oxman.
Oh, fine. How are you?
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Hunh.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
I know.
You should be.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
But what did you get on your SATs?
He did?
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
What happened!
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
Yeah?...
What happened?
I guess not Cooper...
Are you going to kill us?
Like where--in your dreams?
Yes, you should.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
What the hell is it, anyhow?
What!
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
I say we head out.
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Moffo!
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Didn't they tell you?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
What did you say, sir?
No, sir.
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
No, sir.
That's right, Major.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
Just a squirt.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Why can't you cancel it?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Admiral Buldike?
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Lothar, take your checks now.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
War?
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
They're moving apart.
Yeah?
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Primary arming switch.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
Quentin, how's your gear?
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
Sorry, King.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
But I get a red light.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
But who would be chosen?
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Oh.
Right now?
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
What?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Ah!
Okay, okay.
So you can do an album cover?
No, no.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Guess not.
No.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Hey.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Buff is funny. God.
I'm so burnt-out.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Okay.
It's nice here. It's different.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle-class.
What'd he get you?
Really?
You cut off your little finger?
What was your name again?
Yeah?
Taking care of business.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Because I'm alienated.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Just put it down.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Nazeer Chaudry!
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Man?
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
Name one.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Us.
And?
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
God, you smell like whiskey.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Just go.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, good.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Yeah.
Well, not exactly.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Camel jockey.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Hey.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Mine too.
You done?
I can't believe you're still here.
You do?
I think I gotta go.
Don't do that.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
At least I have a point of view, you know?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Look, it's really not my fault.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
It's twins!!
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
No...I've been pregnant.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
She thinks you went to the police.
Spit from your dad?
Jack...
Mmm-hmmm...
We're here for you, Diane.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Hold on...
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Bank branch!
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Let it ride for a while.
I'll take it.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
What's wrong with it?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
You did?
Into what? A lampshade?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
I tell you this is half sold.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Second generation, huh?
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
It must be my new shampoo.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
Whose?
Come on, Joe.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Get out.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Get out!
Yeah?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Fair enough.
This is fascinating.
I don't know.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
You can stay here.
I've lost my car.

Come here!
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
A little.
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
This is the right day.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are your...?
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
No, they don't.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Go on in.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
No?
Maybe what you need is another agent.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
But where?
No, a super girl.
Eliminate her.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
It's for your own protection.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
You love me?
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
It seemed that way to me.
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Well, there's several ways to go .
A passionfruit smoothee.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I don't want your help.
Yeah.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Supergirl?
Oh, no thanks.
You bet your ass.
You're supposed to guess.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Can you create life?
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
She's a beast.
You sure?
Somebody's gotta do something!!
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Throw him out.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
I seem to be.
The kid needs a man to show him --
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
But Lana, you could --
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Say!
Nope, but --
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
One.  And a half.
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Or socks.
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
That what they call you?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
For what?
Tell me more...
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Where's the handle?
Storms! Floods!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Don't bet on it!
Yeah. I'll check.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Be my guest.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
We'd better talk.
Let's go to my place.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Oh, hi.
You're not selfish at all.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Does she know about it? She's in it!
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Wrong.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
No possibility for parole?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Constantly.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Cuba.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
We must combine our strength.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
If you say so. Here goes.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Like me?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
I'm sorry.
Go on . . .
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Daddy . . . ?
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Something . . . wonderful.
A toupee that flies?
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Nobody else.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
Well!
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
No.
Not really, no.
But otherwise it's swell.
Don't you ever give up?
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Jealous? Of what?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Screaming
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
You're on.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
I know...
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Of course I can. I love you.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
What's your name, boy?
He sure as heck does that.
Folks'll ask question.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
He'll be weightless.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Enjoyed it?
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
How good it felt!
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
195 pounds.
Sure.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I...uh...check.
Otis...
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Maybe I should get help.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
On radio waves?
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Which one?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
Alison.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Can't you make it later?
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Berry-picking.
That would complicate things.
What other people?
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
Will you be spending more than a night?
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Tell me about it.
Thanks.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Yes.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Who are you?
You can't come here.
You've been retained?
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
No.
In what way?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
And where did you sit that morning?
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
Positive.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
The ramp?
It's okay.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
Great.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
The Ottos.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Hitler!
Is "he" inside?
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
See my mother?
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
No...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Now don't kid a kidder.
I have a message from your sister.
I didn't say that, J.J.
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
I read your column every day...
Can't hurt...
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
But not for anything I did today...
She knows now.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
- He's got them on him.
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
Hello.
What sort of thing?
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
I'm used to you...
That's no way to talk...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
No problemo.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Where you going?!
Terminated.
Alright, it!  We need it!
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Go!  I'll finish here.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
Then what?
Yes.
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
Yes.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
Yeah.
With more what? More what?
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
That is correct.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
I wish to say something.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
And what did he say?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
I don't understand what you mean.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Yeah?
He did?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Nope.
Like this bandleader.
Come to the office, please.
You're a big help.
We will, kiddo.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Right.
Kyle.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
About where you're from.
What's that?
Molecular-memory.
That's not my mission.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Ticklish?
Cover...our footsteps...
Why?
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Shut up.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
What <u>is</u> your problem?
It was a gift... from my brother.
If there was one.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
My hero.  Let's go.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
Who the fuck cares?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
What do we do?
I'm back from the dead.
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
I saw them kill him!
Stop talking to them!
Stop talking...
Stop it!
Where are you going in such a hurry?
They'll be wanting it back.
No.
I'm going to call.
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
You're part of it...
Stop this.  It's not true...
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Yes.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
I hope.
What is?
No, thank you.
What's all this for?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
Don't take another step.
The key?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
I'm not sure.
No.
No.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
It was a misunderstanding.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Nothing else?
Greetings fellow insomniac.
What?
I did okay.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Why?
Do we still get paid for the week?
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
Luke.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
-- how much is this car worth?
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
No.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
She was unhappy.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
I don't know what you mean.
That's why we're here.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
Maybe you did it yourself.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Is that a problem?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
What kind of food?
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
Oh, god.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Why not?
Come over here.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
This is un-fucking professional.
There's been some trouble downtown.
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
Y'what?
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Now who's being sarcastic?
She never told Eddie, though.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Footloose and fancy free.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
My employer.
Why not.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
How do you know?
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
All of what?
And that is?
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Sounds like you need a rest.
I got half.
The forever kind.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
I don't know.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Walked.
I doubt it.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Since when?
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
-- You know his name is Frank.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Ann. Will you come in?
Yes, Ann?
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Hello, Birdy.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Birdy--
Did she make mistakes?
That right.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
And how do we share--
All right, I guess.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
But it's...
I, uh...
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
How are you?
You don't have to--
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
So--
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Whuddya mean?
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
Huh? No.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Hello.
Could you come with me please?
Homicide.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
You'll go to the prison hospital.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
Where's the walk-in safe?
Calm down.  I found it!
What doors?
Where's the head?
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
What is it?
Oh shit.
All right everybody, hold up!
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
I'm not giving up.
You're right.
What are they?
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
He's right.
Footsteps!
Yes, I do.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Big as a house.
Like this.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Frock's been fired.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
It's reptilian.
What kind of hormones?
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
Okay.
You were going to be married.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
Would you mind showing it to me?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
What are you going to do?
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
Oh God!  Help!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I have to shoot.
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
What music?
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
Amnesia.
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
I'm the creator.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Now.
You think so?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Who?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
What's that?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
I've been thinking--
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
I think I'd like a little company.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Well, I made it through another night.
Oh, just so.
Things always do--when you look back.
Were you there--how do you know?
Yeah.
Yup.
Sorry. Don't have one.
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Into what?
You got some kind of business with him?
Looking for him for what?
What's that?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
And one little boy.
Do you?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
Your guess?
I've been using you?!
Where are you, Scully?
Did you find something?
I think they have that covered.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
It's locked?
Something sweet.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Nice try, Mulder.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
I was until about an hour ago.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
I don't know.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
I don't know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Mulder --
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
I don't know.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
She was with me.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
How deep does this go?
Yes.
About the conspiracy?
I want to know where Scully is.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
What do you mean, walked?
Driver.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
A pocketful of rye...
Shush.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
What's wrong?
I did, yeah.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
You're sure of that?
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Absolutely.  Abigail...
No problem.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Initiating connection.
I think that's the whole point.
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Sometime yesterday morning.
I'll get her...
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Now?
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
They think you did it.
Sit down.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
He has a little dog.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
They're forged.
Need we go through it all again?
What's that?
Where is she?
Anna.
Me.
I shall be all right.
I saw him today.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
His.
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
They're Harry's.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
There's nothing in them.
No.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Fellow called Lime.
Yes.
No.
No.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Calloway.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Bring him in.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
All right, Calloway. You win.
I said you win.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Two thirty.
This way, miss.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
No, I don't know...
I'll look it up for you.
What is it, Sergeant?
She's been arrested.
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
You've got plenty of contacts.
At the end of every chapter --
What's the name of this girl?
I have guests waiting.
Hear the details.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
Joseph Harbin.
Never.
Oh.
Not too bad.
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
I have a job.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
People still need values, beliefs....
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
I just read it....
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Why won't you talk to me?
You can't.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
What's it mean?
Why?
Why not?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
Even though his dick is so big?
No difference.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Lina, come here!
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
And be crushed.
You gotta get out of here.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
How would you kill him?
What about Curtis Zampf?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What??!?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Notice? Like what...?
Why?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Listen to me....
What were you, following me?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
Get the fuck away from me.
I can't help what I think.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
You do it on the inside....
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Just do it.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Why me?
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Obviously.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Fund-raising??
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Yes.
No.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Italian is practically the same thing.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
No.
Okay.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
You know what I'm talking about.
I won't, I swear.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Don't.
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
Yes, I know.
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
Well that's very nice of you.
Who?
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Thank you...
... The way she moves.
I got fired.
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
... Are you sure?
No.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Louis, we were French!
Again?
Haven't you been listening?
No.  I'm just depressed.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
Let him sleep.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
What's your first move?
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Oh. Okay.
We go to the same temple.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
That's some cold shit.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
No, it was the perfect level.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Resting?
Why not?
Good looking?
What about me?
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
Let's get in your truck.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
You found the leopard!
Where? Where did you find it?
What arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Hey —— I'm over here.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Yes?
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Go on foot.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
Yeah.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
What! You can't be --
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
You a tourist?
When will they be back?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
And that is the last time any...
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Disney! How inter...
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
You’re mad...
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Leon hung himself.
You don’t say.
Good.
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
Have we done business before?
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
What...?
Where is he?
...On holiday?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
Good.
Should I?
Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
Your secretary, huh!
Yes. How did...
I hope it’s not too significant.
Okay. Recommended...
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
How are you, Rhian?
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Er... Yes...
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
I know his work better than I know him.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Où est passé ton salon?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Fuck...
What do you think, huh?
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
So... pretend it's not a game.
Yes, my lord.
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Jeanne, no...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
But it is what I want.
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
And when was that?
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
We want her burned as a witch!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
And God who allowed you to be caught?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Last night.
No... I want to be confessed.
He's feeling wonderful.
You think?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
If there was, I didn't see it...
That's not a lot.
20,000 gold crowns.
I know...
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
God.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
We're taking back the Tourelles!
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
We need another ten minutes...
Not yet.
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Jeanne, look behind you.
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
That's now what I meant...
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Don't swear...
I'd sooner die than use magic!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
No.
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
Why not?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
Oh no?  How about this one?
Really?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
I don't think so.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
No...
Whose were they?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Jeanne, be patient.
Oh, yes. I remember.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
Just over a year.
Dead.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
I'll be fine.
What's happened?
What?
Thanks.
Who's recruiting?
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, please.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Do they?
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
You're out, aren't you?
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
They were taking you away.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Not this week.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw. Where?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
No, I don't think so?
In the attic.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
We're getting out.
Watch his hand
It will be very dramatic.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
No, not words.
I just want to listen.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
On your piano, that is the swap.
What will I play?
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
That's right.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
He'll probably fall down.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
Here.
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
I had some appointments.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
We'll be waitin'.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
Forget it.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
You mean you blew it.
You know anything about him?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
No, not a thing.
Did he say he wouldn't?
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
The wire is ten years outa date.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Five and call.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Sixty-five.
You move right along, don't ya.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Give 'em a little time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
For fifteen years.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Nothing.
Another young man.
That is, if it's all right with you.
What are you talking about?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Hello, there!
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Yes.
Macaulay.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Oh, thank heaven.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
That's the truth.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Yes, she would.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
A new invention?
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
She could tell you where father is.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
We were looking for this bird.
No.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
I think we're on the right track.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Rosebreen.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
No.
Well, what?
Did you go?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Want to take a poke at him?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
You've said that for weeks.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
All right.  All right.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
What did you do with the rest?
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Yes?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
Hello, baby.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Take it easy.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Your guess is as good as mine.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Maybe I will.
Catch me letting you go alone!
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Not with all your money!
Sure I will.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I did find him!
That's a fact.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Huh?
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
Smart gal.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I wish you'd tell me.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Maybe she has.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Home!
Y-yes.
Baghdad.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
It's a fortune box.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
For climbing.
You just go when I say go.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
What do you figure it to be?
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
Then get up and do something about it.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
I have to answer him.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Wh-what do you think--
It's the only way.  We drive!
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
We leave it.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I heard it.
Just be cool.
Epps...
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
What are they doing here?
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
Just stay down.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
We'll find our way.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
We'll lie.
Sure.
Damn.
You sure you want me too?
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
Somebody has to.
Yeah.
I don't know.
He'll slow down.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
A headache?
Okay.
Yeah, you're funny.
For real?  A treasure?
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
What?
Yeah.  So?
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
What?
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Oh, God!
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
What's the matter with you?
You've seen enough.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Don't be so sure.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't know.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
No!...No!...
What?
Where is LUH?
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Go ahead.
Anything else I should know?
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Right.
Nothing.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
We work fast enough for you?
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Hey, I'm next.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
We've created a monster.
Security.
Nothing... just tired.
Stay here.
Maybe she knows your old man.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Nothing so far.
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
I don't know...
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
What?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Goddamit, Reilly--
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
I thought I told you--
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
And diamonds in the front.
Very well, Jacques.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
Where did you find it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
You've never been in Constantinople?
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
The type they marry.
Nice suit.
I thought so.
Just dull.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
I hope so, too.
No, not at all!
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Just as you say, Doctor.
Good day, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
No--no.
No--proud. Very proud!
No, thank you.
Last year? It can't be that long.
Seven and nine!
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Lily-- 
I know that niche.
I remember.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh! You didn't read it!
What's wrong now?
Peaches and cream.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
No. What is it? Tell me.
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
That sounds sensible. 
Then I mislay my checkbook--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Lipstick?
You would?
So you think you can get me?
On the night table.
Please! 
<u>Adolph</u>?
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
What is it, madame?
I know!
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Yes, my bag!
An hour, two at most.
Thank you, Rose.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Don't you mean work me?
Rose Calvert.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Yes, exactly!
Just some sketches.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Jack, I --
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
This is crazy.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Isn't that interesting?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
<U>Gladly</U>.
We'll be expecting you.
Fine--I'll be glad to.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
Yes--
I could stand some more--
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
You work too fast for me, young man.
Never eat before the show.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Sorry.
Sally--!
You said it! How about a little action?
I'll be waiting on deck.
Jimmy!
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
I'll watch for him, sir.
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
No, sir?
Change?
Now you're talkin'!
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
What is it?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Sure, I'll go.
Swell!
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Sure.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Well, did you find me?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's fine.
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Is this your gun?
Are you happy?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Like it?
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
I'll never love anybody else.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
Somebody's got to do it--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
I'm getting seasick--
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Eh?... Oh.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Sure, Sis.
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Hey--you! Where you going?
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Not now.  I don't have time.
I don't understand.
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
Excuse me?
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Yeah, you look it.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
Here it come: one-two-
I was kidding about that.
Say when.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
But Doc-
No...
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
I don't.
Awful lot of money.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
There's no reasoning with him.
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
You'd die for fun?
What about her?
Where do you get these questions?
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Fortuitous even.
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
No really, I can stay a while.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
You wanted to talk?
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
I know.  And nobody can make him.
Fine.  Better.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Acquired?
I know, I need a keeper.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Sightseeing.
...Words to live by?
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Where can I find him?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Is that any way to say hello?
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Who knows? Fog, night...
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
I didn't think so.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Let's not make it a habit.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
- The family jewels?
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
He was my father's best friend!
Don't say it.
Next time, I do the driving.
Now.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
I see you two have met.
Excellent.
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Since when?
We got the same thing.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
Will you still get the money from your father?
Like muddy waters?
You were in hell?
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
What for?
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Go back to sleep.
You all act like two roosters.
Hush.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
Well, I would appreciate that.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
I'll be right there.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Good afternoon to you.
Hattie is a different person now.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
I was just trying to make conversation.
No, I haven't seen him.
But Mom, I can't find him!
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
You mean that happy child?
Trouble?!  Where?!
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Alright Buzz, get ready...
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Yeah, right.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Woody!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Woody!  The rocket!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
How 'bout three out of five?
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
She's sick!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
You murdering dog!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
I was close to being scared that time.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
I thought he was at summer camp!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Speed up!
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Get away from me...
Can you move over a wee bit?
H'm?
Did you now.
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
Storms?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Arnie, this is crazy.
What is he being charged with?
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl, that's insane.
Me, too.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Barbara --
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
So's the video camera.
Caroline --
Not yet.
Hi.
Just watching you.
You can't make me.
Cincinnati Country Day.
Yeah.
I'm third in my class.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
I feel good.
So does half of San Diego.
When will you do it?
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
That thought makes me feel awful.
Yes, sir!
I don't believe you.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Yeah.
I don't know.  Something.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Your new friends.
Where?
No.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
Javier Rodriguez.
An informant.
It was an anonymous tip.
What is it you want me to do?
Noriega is a criminal.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I don't know what to say.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
Thanks.
It's where I live.
What?
Because it's illegal.
Easy for you to say.
Certainly not.
Is that a promise, then?
Too young for what?
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Sixteen next month.
It's an interesting theory.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Aye.
And you might get the fucking job.
Another dab?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
OK, so who was it, then?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Roald Dahl.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
He made me lick it.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
It was just an idea.
Are you serious?
Well, it's up to you.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
No joy yet.
What?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
Rescued at last.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Raise shields.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
It's all I have.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
If we could send a distress signal...
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Doctor.
I cannot be certain.
If you think it would help.
I did not.
Is what possible?
The emergency channel, open.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
Now learn something about yourself.
Because you, too, must know.
No. I will not.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Okay, okay...
To warn him.
I'm certainly not.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Right on the money!
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
Yeah, I... oops!
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
Why? What are you going to do?
Probably.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Tron...?
Recognizers!
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
End of line.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
That's all going to change, Yori...
Why is everything...like this?
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Okay, Dad.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Why?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
You want me to just hang-- ?
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
I still don't believe it.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes sir.
I'd like that.
I agree.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Oral hygiene?
You're damaged goods, lady.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
They must've just missed me.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
He needed my help.
No.
What did you need?
Answer the question--
Yes or no.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
No.  Doris.
You wouldn't believe me.
What about Juno?
Did you pork her Harry?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
God, you have great legs.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Those idiots.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Go ahead.
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Helen.
What letter?
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
How come?
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Now hang up.
The oriental.
What time is it?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
How 'bout me what?
At the movies?
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
What?
I heard that.
Heard that.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
You got it.
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Every word of it.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Where?
No shit? Dick, that's great!
Really?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
I guess so. Follow me.
No.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
She seems very nice.
Do you still have friends on the force?
No.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
Sure.
I believe he believes him.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Or a supporting actor -
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
No.
Exactly room-mates.
Where's that?
Uh, what?
What's she doing?
And your only goal is...???
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
No more drugs.  Please...
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
Jeffrey Mason?
I thought I was in...prison again.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
I...I...We need cash, James.
You... you left them a message?
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
You know -- your plan.
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
You want to go in?  Examine him?
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
You want something, old man?
Christ no!
Yeah, yeah.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Will be.
Out of here.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Yep.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Twenty-after-ten.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
You got beer?
Kirin?
Genuine Draft?
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Sheriff Potter.
Who the hell is this!?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I don't know your real name.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
I just drove in this morning.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Still playing?
You know what I want.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Where?
I wanted to talk.
What about us?
Stop it.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
Don't yell at me!
There has to be!
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
What about him?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Give him the money.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
You killed him!
You could give me the gun.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
I'll get it.
What for?
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
Accident.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
About what you said this morning.
I do.
And tell her what?
You didn't kill her?
Came close this time and it scares you.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
No.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Come on, Jake--
You're not talking sense.
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
How old are you?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you.
Stand up.
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
I don't understand what the--
Sure, Sheriff.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
And you're taking?
Senor, you need a doctor.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
You afraid of the dark?
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Yeah...
That's a solid name.
Live there?
Ah, I can smell it on you.
About what you said this morning.
You're talking like a madman.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
It's not what you think, Jake.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Get away from me!
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What sign?
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
I'm just going to my car?
Do you have to call me that?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You should be more careful.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Come here.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Like you.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
I have an idea.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You could leave him.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Is it pretty?
There is no us, remember?
Because I know you're full of shit.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
You could give me my gun back.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Bobby? Are you all right?
Can you make it back up?
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
What does that mean?
He's asleep.
Do you remember me getting sick?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
Rust?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
What was that?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
Seventy-five percent.
Is there a problem?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
I'll help you.
Elijah was wrong.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
No.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Why?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
We was... lyin'.
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
He admit it?
Property.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
What's your name?
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Oh.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
What happened, did you hit him?
Yeah.
I can't see 'em.
First one what?
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
Lemmee see it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
You ain't shot.
You sure you ain't armed?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
You ain't like that no more.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Beats the hell out of me.
You're marking us, Bill.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
He's dead, Bill.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Best we move that pig.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
Just like that?
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
There's more.
Just forget about it.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
Alright.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
You are a criminal.
Then who goes?
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
They fucking know everything.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Not if we do it my way.
Who's Keyser Soze?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
Who's your boss?
We'll see.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
Business or personal?
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Two hours, tops.
Someplace else, then.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
No.
I'm not a rat.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
What lawyer?
Kobayashi.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
But Keaton...
Edie.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
It looks that way.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
No.
Through, through his book.
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
Huh!
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
I...yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
You've just said you signed it.
I thought I would need it.
... that's all right.
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
No, you did fine.
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Yes.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Right.  Who called?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
...things change.
Yes.  Price...
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Still looking.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Laura.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You're talking like a drunk.
Who told you that?
If I don't 'grow up...'
I have to talk to you.
He's not in, Sir.
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What do you want?
What?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
You got a good memory, Franky.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Oh shit, what's today?
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
The broad has disappeared...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
Yes.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
You live in the neighborhood?
Thanks, Franky.
Yeah.
How'm I doing so far?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I married into it.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
And when she goes to those places...
Why?
-- and how you happen to be living here.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I want to know who you are.
Don't go.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
Wherever you'd like...
Oh, yeah. There.
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
No!
No! Let me go!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Yes!
What are you going to do?
I loved you, Madeleine.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
No...
Why?
This afternoon.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
No.
I... didn't know where you lived.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Wander about.
What?
What?
Good-bye.
Well... anywhere in particular?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
No birds live here.
The tall trees...
Long ago...
I know.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
I love you too... too late... too late...
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Yes.
I won't lose you.
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It wasn't your fault.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
What a pleasant hobby.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
That!?!
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Who?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
And she died...
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
How soon can it be altered?
Can we have it by tonight?
I need a drink.
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
First of all...
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
Multiple reasons.
Why was the floor wet?
You're not a team player.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
I'm calling the ambulance.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
What?
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Any time fat boy!
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
Later.
Don't eyeball your kids.
What happened? Oh my God...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Where is she?
Fish?
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
Not tonight.
Left side.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
I can't.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
He is not cracking up.
What does that mean?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
I'm serious.
Ball park sausages.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
What?
Government cutbacks.
I think so.
I think I forgot the tent.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What are you talking about?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
It's vile!
Okay.
What kind of seats can we have?
So what do we do?
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
Of course.
Not yet.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
No. Just like an hour or so.
What!
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
I won't even discuss it.
No.
No it's not okay. It's not.
The prostitute.
Move the bodies.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
You did all right dad.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Go for it.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Buzzing?
Yup.
A mutant species.
It was an accident!
No, the children sleep with me.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
You'd like me to kill them?
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Two.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
What's that?
What about them?
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
What's the matter?
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Fifteen yards.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Nothing.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
Where's the dough?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Things seem to be getting better.
Stop this!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Where?
He couldn't get through the door, then?
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
From the terrace.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
He was a computer program for crissake.
What about them?
What she's going to do is get in my way.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
This is supposed to be years away.
How do you kill it?
Talk so I can understand.
Then fix it.
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
Help me get out of here.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I've been in prison, remember?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Enjoying yourself?
You like baseball?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Thanks.
You don't know?
Duck!
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
For Schumann.
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
Come on.
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Who's got the story? 
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
And you?
....we landing?
...that's the general idea.
...<u>nothing</u>...
The Hostages...?
...this's <u>good</u>...
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
Knock on wood.
...they just hadn't thought it through...
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
Fine. 
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.

ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I have.
...you the Press Office?
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
...uh ... No, that's...
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
...that's what it is.
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.

I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.

No.  You're right.
Watch me.

...they... <u>you</u> know...
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
Show some compassion.
They don't know what's going on!
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
...gotta read my reports.
All right, I owe you one Marv.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
No sir, that would've been illegal...
What? How do you know about my father?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
...I can't make it tonight.
Gordon.
Excuse me.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Upper West Side.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Hmm.
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Jenkins!
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
No?
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
That's not what you said last night.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
China
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Right behind you.
Hi there Sarah
Sell my soul?
They're all human beings
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I know he does.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
A ghost?
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Fine.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Nope.
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Do you?
You were in an accident?
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
Um...yes.
Is everything alright?
I'm not...
You do?
Thank you.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Um...sure.
Yeah.
I don't know.
This is...
Do we have to?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
Jody, no...
Please.  That's all I need.
I don't...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
The planchette?
I think so
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Why?
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
No.
Did he say that?
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
It's Saturday.
Nope.
After that.
Of him I think.
I know.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
That's...
I'm so sorry.
Did you call about the Feurs?
No.  Look!  In the window.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
What am I looking at?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Yep.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
What's wrong with me?
Wouldn't go that far.
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Who?
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
What?
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
But you've not told Michael.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
I don't want it.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
I under5tand.  All the same
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
I bring her flowers too.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
I love Michael...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
Rowan...
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
Really...?  Your family there...?
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
All I meant was -
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
What about you coming down here...?
- a witch.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
Let's see.
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
That's GREAT!
Their what...?
Mm-hmm...
That's cause we're below sea level.
Your beneficence.
Lock the door.  Lock it
What were you talking about...?
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Stop it!
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Yes it is...
No - not all the time - I mean
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Sure...
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
Yes, one and a half please.
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
Then make it stop...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
He doesn't need to...
What was I supposed to do?
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
No worries
I'll be sure to...
You and your pep talks.
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
These are real, live women?
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
From your lips, to God's ears.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
So that's a maybe?
Do it?
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
We own a small family grocery store.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
I guess.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Just say it, Dad.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
You ordered a Winnebago?
Watch your tone, mister.
I will not have my boys arguing.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Hmmm?
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
So, what brings you here at his hour?
Very funny.
It's not up to me.
I didn't forget.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Your article sucked.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
Well? Where the hell are you?
Amen to that.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Only the best for my mother.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Rules are rules.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Of course I like girls.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Tipping?
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
I... You know... I...
Kelly.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
What about the blood?
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
He was large?
Ray thinks she was murdered.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Suzie?
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
The skinny brunette.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Where's Lombardo?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Did he come in with you?
Where's this coming from?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
I said he did.
No!
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
You notice my new jumper?
I miss Dad.
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Do it to ourselves?
Hello.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
I love you.  Now give me the line.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Story's the same, Detective...
And she wanted to talk.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Are you mad at me?
That was the same thing Ray said.
We?
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Hi, Sandy.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Wouldn't dream of it.
You need that real often?
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Almost?
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Oh, thank you.
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
I've had some practice.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
My friend?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
I deal with some tough customers.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Yes!
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
They're coming.
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
You're not a woman.
I have no family.
I hate this.
You?
Well what did she say?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Ahhh!
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
No.
What do I need for that?
Me!
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
His will.
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
He never misses.
Me neither!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Yes, sir.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
Sure have, Sam.
Maybe.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Just us.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I was wrong.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
What?
Oh. The bullets.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
I don't know where he is.
I know.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
I have to help him!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Oh ....
Ohhh!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Toto, too.
Has it poppies on the wall....
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Well, you're perfect now.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh --
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
You've had plenty of time already!
You're right -- I am a coward.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Ohhh!
Yes -- that's true.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Ah --
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Yeah --
Yeah.
Don't push!
Not nohow!
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
No, sir!
Hurry -- hurry --
Oh - look out.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Well, that's you all over.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
It makes you nervous?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Elektra would control it all.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
So isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
Who?
The worm on the hook again.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
I can’t tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
Really?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
You do what you have to do, but I’ve called in M.  She’s en route from London even now.
Not interested.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
Elektra, it’s not too late.  Eight million people needn’t die.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
How appropriate.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Please.
Of course...
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
What?!
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Hello, Adrian.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Because --
I won't do that.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
What if you¹re wrong??
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
His . . . whatever.
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
Antarctica??
Okay!
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
I don't think she's coming with us.
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
We should get back --  What?
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Janey, will you marry me?
-- What?
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I don't know their real names.
Am I free to go?
Jon??  You mean he's --
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Is that a fact?
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Naturally.
What weapons do you have?
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Go to hell.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
We hung out last night, remember?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
When can I see you again?
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
You don't have to do that.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Been to any good diners lately?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
When else are you gonna do it?
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
Had to do what I had to do.
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
We all do.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
What's that?
You know, you --
By reading my thoughts?
I've seen a lot of rings.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
How?
Enough for a test.
ALIVE.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
You have the wrong house.
No!
Now wait a minute!
I did, sir.
Is it that music?
Very....very!
Whatever makes you happy.
You're incorrigible!
Goodbye, darling.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Fron kon steen!
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
My father was a sick man.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
What wockers?
Fro-derick!
What?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Could be worse!
Could be raining!
I have a pretty good idea.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
All right... elevate me!
What?
What?
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Who are you talking to?
It wasn't me.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
It's the only way.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
How nice.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Raise the platform, hurry!
I thought it was wonderful.
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Me?  Sing?
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Good night!
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Yes.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Thank you.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
