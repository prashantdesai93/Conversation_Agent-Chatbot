Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
do you listen to this crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
They do to!
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
Let go!
I just wanted --
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Get out!
Why not?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Assail your ears for one night.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Hey -- do you mind?
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
You don't care if I die
Why?
Dorsey.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I thought you were above all that
I should do this.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
So what did I have an effect on ?
The Partridge Family?
So what's your excuse?
You up for it?
The duck?
What?
No.
No, I won't go with you
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Macbeth, right?
Say it
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
We should have seen land.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
They took everything...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
You defend yourself admirably...
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Say not here!  Cuba!
To bring the word of God.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
I have to disagree.
New worlds create new people.
The ocean is uncrossable?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
What's he doing?
You must be mad...!
You bloody...
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Don't say anything.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What are you asking me?
I'll make some for us.
What are you doing?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
What was that, Korfin?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Who's there?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
I don't even watch TV.
Two heads.
You thirsty?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
I kill someone famous.
How many victims are up there?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Hey, honey.
Stop it.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Okay, til tonight.
You promise?
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
In here, says he wants a million.
What?
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
Traitor!!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
You've got a call.
Viewer discretion advised!
I'm trying to tell you.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
I'll take him.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
You okay?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Mouth's clean, too.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
What??
What?
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
How was it?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
CONTINUED
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Well, that's something.
Hal?
Well, don't worry about it.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.

I'm having a party tomorrow.
When are you coming home?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Thank you.
Roger.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Now how's your memory doin'?
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I'm candy...
You're gonna help us take him.
Where's ganz?
Yeah, I noticed...
Bullshit.
Yeah.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
I don't give out the details.
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Let's go.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
I been waiting a long time for some money.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the money?
Right, partner.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
No class...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Where's luther?
What about Luther?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
That was quick.
Why?
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Thanks.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
What the bell happened?
That's what you say, Cates...
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
I'm all wet.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Hey, I don't believe it.
You real down?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
We got a lot to talk about.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Billy, go ahead, break it...
You chickenshit punk...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
You want to go outside?
Five.  On credit.
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Who are you?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
We have to save the world.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Where's Leeloo?
Do you love her?
At least, the cat comes back.
I just found a picture of you.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
...Priest...
...What's your name?
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Hi Ma...
Other than that... You all right?
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Six to the left. One to the right.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Is that all?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
It's up to you now, Angel!
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
Staedert, do you read me?
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
...Not far, now.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Okay, I believe you.
Tom...
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What are these?
What do you want?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
A fellow investor.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Is that him?
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Who is this.
What's he talking about?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
How much did he pay you?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Do it.
You're making me very angry.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Remember me?
How long you been working there?
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
How old are you?
Where are your parents?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Who is he, his name?
What's next?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
You... you need to go to the police.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
How are you?  Having any luck?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Yes... ?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
Do you know what happened to her?
Okay, I'll take it all.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't go back to sleep again.
We'll figure it out.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
You've been up all night?
No...
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
I've been working double shifts.
How long have you been awake?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
So?
Nice neighborhood.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What's wrong with me?
Excuse us, dear.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
The tickets.
I'm so sorry, honey...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
You disappointed in me?
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Did everyone call everyone?
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Are you alright?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Where are you going?
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
I don't understand.
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Vomit?
You could train someone else.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Swell!
See what?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Always has been.
Who?
No.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
I plan to. Soon.
Yes.
You heard the news.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
If you get it?
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
I used to play ball.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
I'm fucking out of here.
You know.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
No what?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Jesus, why?
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Pop?
How about a Big Mac?
What do you want, then?
You're a policeman.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
What do I have to do for it?
Lillian!
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
See. Get your boots.
No problem. Look, I...
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Call me.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Oh, Wade.
You've been married twice --
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Coffee's perked.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Something about my father?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Marg!
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Who?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Get some sleep.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
You don't want to say hi to your father?
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Mom?
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Alice!
How you doing, sweetie?
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
They aren't answering their hails.
Sir, you threw out page two.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Why?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
There goes your ride.
Finally, we can bargain.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
I don't know why you stayed.
One.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
You wanna knock of f?
IT'S OPEN!
Did you feel that?
It's got to be stopped!
Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
Simon, what's happening?!
Can't we change course?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Captain Oveur?
You folks need any help?
You've been hurt.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Captain, how soon can we land?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Elaine!
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
What's the matter?
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Rats! I've lost number three.
See them, Elaine?
We have a visitor.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
He didn't recognize me.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
What's this?  What's going on?
What is this?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Tell me.
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Who is he?
Your health...
Where'd you get this?!!
Stop the car.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
Shit!
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
No!  We must do this alone.
What is this?!
Harcourt is dead.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
That where Anderson worked?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
What kind of test?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
And it's too late to shut it down?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
You did okay, Bishop.
I get the picture.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
I hope you're right.  I really do.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
What's he scanning for?
One of us?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Save it.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
Locked.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Cross my heart.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Gone.
Don't go!  Please.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
How do you know?
Where?
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
What does he look like?
What?
No, she's fine.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Humiliated?
What is it?
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
No, I'm not playing this game.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
What's the matter with you?
Yes!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
What are you doing here?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Where's our friend?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
He's adorable!
Hey!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
What a strange young man.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Sire.
Why not?
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Do you like this, Salieri?
What do you mean, Sire?
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Would you tell me why?
Well, what do you have for me today?
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Is he working?
Opera? Opera!
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
What?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Love, Sire!
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
How could I not?
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
I can't say. Really
Really? Why?
Yes?
How long will you give me?
No, please.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Who?
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Yes.
And that's it. Do you have it?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Is the Emperor angry with me?
No, but I'm the best.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Herr Mozart -
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
How well are you trained in music?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Yes.
Oh my son, my poor son!
He's setting that play to music?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Ballet? What ballet?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well, promise then.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Herr Salieri.
Go about your duties.
He's not?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Surely you're not suggesting...
No, why?
Shall I send a car?
Do you like it?
Now what do you want to talk about?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
The kitchen.
Alex?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
I've left those pills for you.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Hello, Benjamin.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
How long have I been here?
There were witnesses?
You're talking about the woman I love.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
Okay.
Hello.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Go on, ask them.
Beware the moon?
Could be a lot of things.
Heathcliffe.
No, but he was on the moors.
What's the plan?
It's in front of us.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
What?!
Shut up, you zombie!
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Hi, Jack.
No, thank you, Doctor.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
What here?
Sorry, love.
What's that?
Oh.
I don't rightly know, sir.
No kidding?
Charlie!
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Where you been?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
We want to talk to you.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Say, you can't do that—
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Thanks.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Fifty thousand dollars!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Doesn't that come next?
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
Well, what?
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
I don't know.
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Oh!
Got my letter?
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
Why pick on him ?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
In Cluett's office?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
What time was it?
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it—
Then who changed it?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
He's smiling.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Uhh, yeah it does.
We got a problem here, brother?
This is the best score yet.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
I'm sorry, Cole.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Yesterday.
The Army can hang him.
Beg pardon?
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
You shut up now, boy.
Not now.
She had a moustache.
Thanks for the help.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
What are you saying?
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Missed you, cousin.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Well?
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Another dozen out back.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
Boys...
You know you're welcome any time!
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
We're doing this for Ma.
We're drunk.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Can't argue that.
Uncle Frank?
Riders --
Doc Mimms will --
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Yep.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Zee.
Was it worth it?
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Now let's have a drink.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Not at all.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
How can that be?
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
Your men knew the risks.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
I know. Stop it.
Dorsia's nice.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
It's a plain end, see? So?
Why?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
What are you doing tonight?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
He's good-looking.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
No, no, no.
But where?
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
That's Paul Owen.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
We are totally booked.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
After six.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
I'll do it.
Yes?
Who?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Do you have a boyfriend?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Patrick? Is that you?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
So, what do you do?
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Would you rather I not smoke?
How well did you know him?
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Have you consulted a psychic?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
What?
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
Yes.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
I'm just screwed.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
What!
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
Milo?
Here we go.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Milo?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Milo? I'm Danny.
It scales, don't you think?
Had you talked to him much lately?
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
This is good. Who did it?
Okay, #2.
What're we looking for?
You calling Phil and Randy?
You know mine.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
What've you got there?
Did you wanna be alone?
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
...Milo?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
I don't know --
Why were you so careless?
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Bring it to the other location.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
So how'd you like the house?
What're they building?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Come in.
Care for some saki?
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Hungry.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My meat and two veg.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Watch out, you're on my hair!
Oh, yes you are.
Hello, luv.
Who?
Does that make you horny?
I love you, Austin.
Kiss me.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
Noooooooooooooo!
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Shut up.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
In due time.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
What did you say?
Umm, that also has already happened.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
How's Austin?
Did you ever want to?
And how do you feel about that?
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Really?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Nature ...
Secret ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Then you can't come in.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
People, too.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
Who?
You.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Choices?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
Do you?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
What on earth?
But
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Do you always drive this fast?
I could save you the trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
You're playing games.
I'm playing to win.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
No, after you.
Aren't you coming?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Makes two of us.
I was getting to it.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Oh, hello ...
Amnesia?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
This man -- did you see him?
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
You with Mother or Father?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
You said ... one shot.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
What's happening?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
I've decided not to run for President.
Cole...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I don't want any trouble.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Huh? Wha...
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Let go of me!
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Why is Cole here?
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Your whores never showed up.
That's it, prick lips.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Hookers beat you up?
What can I be doing for you?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
It's on the tenth floor.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
Ed... you're kinky!
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
What the hell is that?
Under the table!
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Hey, you guys...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Reach out and snort someone.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You're late again, Rick.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Wash it to the windows?
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
Is he...
You gotta let me finish --
It doesn't go like that.
Why'd you come here, Brian?
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Ready?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Brian, look --
I saw it.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
Brian.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Thanks for the invite.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
I was doing my job.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What is --
I'm sorry.
I'll see ya around, huh?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Who the fuck is doing this?
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Nice bunch of guys.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Then who wrote the report?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
So what do you want me to do?
Your brother was a good man.
I have a job.
Completely out of control.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
What?
So, you surviving without me?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
They're waitin' man.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
I treated you better.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Didn't think you'd make it.
Knock it off. Now.
Nobody cares, Ronald.
-- Burn them.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
I'm a little busy right now --
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
Large?
I want 15 on the Mets.
How's the case going?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
...Benedict Arnold...
You don't have the demographics.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
What's that?
Please, have a seat.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
Good morning, Cheeba.
De-la-croix.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
My tap shoes.
You're now Mantan.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Mantan?
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
How was it?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Hello.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
You've said that already.
We both lied to him.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
Who's side are you on?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
Don't make me have to use this.
So they can be on TV.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Richmond is not all the way down south.
No.
You know how your Daddy is.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Money and nothing else?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
No, not that.  How 'bout...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...not that time...
Around...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I don't know who I am.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
What else?
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
And?
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
O'Grady.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
For whom else have you worked?
I believe they will deport you.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
Never.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible?
Was he cheated?
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Yes, he's fine.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
I beg your pardon?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Can I at least have a drink?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
Did -- did you --
What about Pike?
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
There's no need...
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Where?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Cadet, what's your name!
What the fuck is going on?
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
Mueller.
Why?
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
What happened to "degrees"?
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
MAYBE WHAT --
How are you?
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
Yeah.
You think you could explain all this to me?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Move him.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
I didn't shoot West...
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Little bit.
So what now?
Four --
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
What if I don't want it?
West?
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Your phone number?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Pike, please --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
I was freezing from the hurricane --
He said what?
No one else heard it?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
It won't work --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
You want Kendall, don't you?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
What is this place?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Helping people makes me happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
You don't like it?
Okay.
You're not trying to run away?
The one about the witch.
Why not religion, Dad?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
The river.
How can I convince you to stop?
I was drying out.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I don't believe it!
Were you and my father having an affair?
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
I need you on my side.
How did you get here?
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Was she one of your teachers?
Is he awake?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
It's enough isn't it?
Do you like it?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Sorry. You've lost me...
Yes. I know.
Right.
No.
What was that?
You must have a visa or something...
I...
Tell me.
Tell me what he said.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
I understand. I'm so sorry
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Oh Jesus.
Just leave her alone.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
Fine.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
We'll pretend it never happened.
I don't hate you.
Sometimes which?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You don't understand me.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I don't have nothing.
Have you had any before?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah. No thanks.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
What does it mean?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
The fuck you laughin' at?
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
How you let men treat ya like they do?
You some kind'a pervert?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
You take it straight?
Could you do somethin' for me?
Where you gonna be?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
What is it?
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
Shit. Who hasn't?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
He tapped that.
How a girl get like that?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
You get a call from Rose?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
Heard about this morning.
I skipped lunch.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
I'm a what?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
I just wanted some make-up.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Back-up.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Frank Abolofia.
What are you doing?
Getting very weird.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Squid?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
I've continued working on the case!
Did I say that?
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Nick --
Nick!
It's illegal, Nick.
No...
Nick, you can't do this.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Joyce?
What's that for?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
I need your help, Joyce.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
And I'm supposed to care?
Where's the wife?
Keep the change.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
What's this?
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
With these?
What's the point?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
You could help us.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
I think, therefore I am.
What was he after?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
I was just about to have my dinner.
She was gonna get away.
I didn't like her.
Yeah.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You start.
What about a summary then.
Yes?
Not if it works.
Number three.
I think I have no money.
Prosit.
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Money?
But you haven't put in for emigration.
You're going to be over the limit.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
I've already got more help than I need.
Who is this?
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
Do you dream?
They could clean around the arrangement.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
You're sick, Deckard.
Uh-huh.
You know what I think?
Is this to be an empathy test?
How many questions did it take?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Same thing.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
Oh, now, that's a great one!
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
Well, that depends...
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
So far?
Right.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Nope.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
It's Perry!
Over this?
Hey, what are you doing?!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
Thank-Q!
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Very funny, smart ass.
Wait! Wait!
Then forget it.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Now, get out!!
I was wrong!!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
All right.
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
You wanted to see me!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Uh-huh. Adam?
Really?  Okay!
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
But, I don't understand.
You're sure?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Who use to own it?
What's the capitol?
It's so small.
Why not? He has great pants.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Why did you park way back there?
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
Good-bye, Adam.
Help you?
Say what?!
I do alright.
Hello.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
Well, where are you --
No.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
He drank it hot?
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
To go up.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Calvin!
Let's eat our cake.
In the generator room again?
Should we say a little prayer first?
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Yes.
We stay down here.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
He's smart.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
You're serious, aren't you?
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Um... Eve?
Where are you going?
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
We came back to the house!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Buy it from me?
Wolf One -- say intentions.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Frank. Come in.
To your health, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
What is this? What color is it?
Okay?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Do you like talk like that?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
I liked being with you last night.
Look.
Falling.
Who is Don?
Yes.
No. I should go.
Come in.
Yes. Frank--
Are you a bad boy?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You called me Jeffrey.
I guess I should go.
I'll call you.
What?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Frank?
Yes, but.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
I'm going out for awhile.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
No.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hi Dad.
Oh yeah?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
That sounds good.
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Probably not. No. Why?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
What did he bring him in for?
Just for him?
Fuck you.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What are you saying?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Anybody see ya?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
They got nothing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
No ma! No!
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
What are you going to do?
me up the...
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Is that right, Rambo?
Where the fuck are you going?
So what do you think?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
He isn't to be touched.
Now, you will receive us.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
And number three, Dolly.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
The what man?
And the pennies?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
Who the...
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
A couple of peons for the mob and...
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
No. You sure you're okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hurry the fuck up!
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
You're right.
I believe these young men are right.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Father, I'll do you right here.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Why?
This is he?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
Where are you going?
Is it back in?
Loop around real fast.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Where's the manager?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
OK. Go ahead.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
She's from Cuba.
When'd he tell you?
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I have an idea for that.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
We've got sixteen dollars.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
What time did he say to be here?
He doesn't want to fight.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
He was a nice guy.
We all set?
Help me move him.
What are you talking about?
You think Applejack knew?
How big is it?
Where?
So how is it in there? 
No. I'm not.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
You mean a safecracker?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
How does that feel?
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
Let them fight.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Where you going?
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
No.
You stole a Trans-Am.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Where'd she go?
I think we might of scared her.
I paid for it.
What are you doing?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
You really think he'll remember you?
Bob, will you please listen?
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
This could be a trap.
Dignan.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Come on!
That's OK.
Is he breathing?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Do you have your own room?
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Is he in?
What do you mean grammar?
Is he good?
What?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
Come on in!
You told me Bourne was dead.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Excuse me.
Berlin!
Sorry to wake you.
Had to be done.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
That's not what happened to your parents.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
Because you're afraid!
I emptied it.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What's going on in Berlin?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
No... How?
But you're sure?
You drive.
Switch! You drive!
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
See that tram coming around the corner?
Looks like he's been detained.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
What kind of problems?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Did you?
Some women like Dobermans --
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Anything?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
But... what will you do?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Young Robert, we are honored --
What news of the north?
Wallace has sacked York!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Rest, William.
Keep these. We're going too.
I have faced him. Have you?
I do not confess.
Thank you for accepting.
I need you so much! I love you!
You have... you have a husband.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Anything.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
Darn it!
What happened?
I don't know... I don't remember.
Please, mom. People will talk.
How. Did you. Know that?
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Are you hurting her?
You really think he wanted to kill you?
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
So how's Tommy?
Not if you remember my dad.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
Why are you doing all this for me?
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
I just thought you should know.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Then you think it might have worked out?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
And you are...?
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Come on, go on...
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Listen to me good, Evan...
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Lenny? Come on!
Here you go, buddy.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
How long have you been married?
Yes, I'll bet.
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Monsieur Rick, I --
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
I see.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
And Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Not an easy day to forget.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Yes, of course, we --
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
For the last time, put them on the table.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
It's been a long time.
Where is Rick?
You are very kind.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Goodnight.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Be careful.
Yes.
-- Is what?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And I congratulate you.
Good evening.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
But we made a deal.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I believe you have a message for him?
And that is?
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
Manages what?
This is the end of the chase.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Oh, how do you do?
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Will I see you tonight?
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Are my eyes really brown?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
He'll double what I pay you.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
What's that you're playing?
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Save some for tomorrow.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
Jesus.
You know what happened to this?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
You?  Personally?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
You know, for when you travel.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
Her name's Hannah.
What's that, written on the sail?
Come on.  Try.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
When's the next Jumbo?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
What happened to your pants?
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
Kamal is not here.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Cool ropes.
That's all there is.
Take your time.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
What, then?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
And that I can drive a truck!
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I've never seen a lobster.
I know.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
People watched the movies in their cars?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
Hi...
There! You said it was boring.
I love you, Wally.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
*Liver* killed him?
What's a nanny do?
Did you grow up around here?
Did you bite it?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
They're migrants.
What's that? What's it called?
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
It's obviously an aborticide.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
Where's the name sheet?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I am not a doctor.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
But you don't look very happy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Do you know him?
Then it's malaria?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
Don't this place look like home?
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
What's this?
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
You're a superstitious fucker.
So we go to the bar.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Whoa. What?
Moonan. Here. Shit...
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
It can buy you a new and better you.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
How much?
Stake you?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Listen, Scooter --
Come here. Feel this.
Come on. Harder.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Sorry, I --
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Attractive girl.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Oh Jesus!
What -- What do we do?
What about... The money?
Says who?
No.  What's my cut?
You need to get a haircut.
How do you know I will?
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Stop waving that thing around.
Uh...
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
King ain't gonna like this.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Sorry. What?
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
You trust this Moonan guy?
I'm Bella.
My car's in the garage.
I hate cheats.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Ouch.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
I get it.
And your lady?
It came my way. 450 a week.
What's the time?
You're shaking. What is it?
I loved it blond.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Why did you take the money?
Great.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
Near the casino.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
They mean it.
Would you like a drink?
How are you?
Did you solve your problems?
Detective Inspector Ross.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
Who are these guys?
And the girls?
Rough day?
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
Where did you go to school?
Why four? And not three or five?
You use two alternating, don't you?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
How many aces are left?
I make it six.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
The key!
It didn't go off.
It didn't go off.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Thanks.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
The only thing which exists is myself.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
What are you gonna name it?
Wha?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
TALBY!
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Who are you?
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
What?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Do you know why I went after Justine?
Why would I be pissed?
What is it?
Lemme put some clothes on.
But I'm afraid of--
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
Which is none of your business...or mine.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
What a creep.
I know.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
You're a thief?
I was expecting someone else.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
So what are you gonna do about it?
Bent.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
What's in it for you?
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
I need to talk to her.
Who are you?
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
A long time.
So are dogs.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Not right now.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
Playing hooky again?
Right, the big one-oh.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
What the hell is that?
You love him?
No problem.
Jeremiah?
Beth? I can't believe it.
Namely?
Any luck?
Whoa... she just farted.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
No... You don't think...?
Dude, this is all I got.
Cool.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Oh, hi, mom.
Mom, what're we...?
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Simplicity, Hawk.
But we took the keys?
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
I did?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
I'm not following you.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Wanna walk me home?
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
That's alright... I understand.
Did you call the cops?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
You're such a fuck-ass.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Who is Frank?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Where are you going?
Cellar door.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
Follow him where?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Nothing.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
People get hurt.
Yes. I went to jail.
Because I'm so horny.
How is that possible?
Then how is time travel possible?
I can see him right now!
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Oh shit!
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
What're you doin' here?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Are we on "Cops" again?
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Oh! What is it?
I will if you shut your piehole.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
What kind of a dog is he?
Well - what is he now?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
I don't wanna work at all.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Send in the next girl. 
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
But -
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Uncle, you can't do this!
They have noble faces.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
What do you mean?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
Yes.
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
Don't!
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
I want my man back.
You've acquired a taste for this?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
How are you feeling today?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
How long has this man been here?
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Alas, no.
Romance!
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
You alright?
Want to come out?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Thank you very much.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
...Yyes
Yes!
Yes.
John... Merrick
Merrick...
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
The hospital?
You look splendid, John.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Yes John?
Won't come out, eh?
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Yes sir.  What's that?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Right! Where is he?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Well... where is he?
What?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
What was she like?
But you LOVED her all the same...
I've never LOVED anybody!
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Halfdan the Black.
Just give me a hand.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
How do we know this is the way?
Is there nothing men can do?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
A lot of people like our singing.
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
No. 
No.
I'll tell you what...
About NOT raping you...
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
You told them I raped you -- why?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Why?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
"But" what?
Let's hack her to pieces.
What?
Who have you been talking to?
I... I... KILLED her...
What are YOU doing here?
What did he say?
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Weren't we supposed to?
There is another way.
Wait, Erik!
Well, what else do we do?
What are you talking about, Erik?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
What's all the panic about?
You're wasting your time.
Same thing, isn't it?
He used to puke in his sleep.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Let me go, Sven.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Well! Come on!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
Help!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah.
Yeah, you told me that later.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
May I help you?
I'm so excited. Yay!
What's wrong with me?
I like it.
Huckleberry Hound?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
You're sure? It's cold.
It's okay.
Where do you live?
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
So you like bookstores, huh?
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
I don't know.
It's pretty.
You just say. I'm not really --
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
So, um --
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Such a beautiful view.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Do you remember what we talked about?
We did talk about Naomi.
I'm sure, I said.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
Yeah?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Male or female?
Cool.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
Bye, Joel.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
It's true.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
That's me.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
It's them.
I should maybe talk to you.
She's so sexy.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
What?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Hi.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
What's this?
Mary...
Thanks.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Yeah?
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
But I don't know how to polka.
Is everything getting worse?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
That's Jellybean!
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
What are you doing?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
For magazines?
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
Holy shit...
Time to play Spam in the can.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
It's holding... She's holding...!
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
How? The Bridge is gone.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
How is he?
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What's happening...?
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
We've got pressure.
Jesus its huge.
Can anybody hear me...
Peters...
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's a negative, Starck.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
I can see that, what're they for?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
Any survivors?
No one?
Yes.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
It's insane.
It's 2041...
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
The "Other Place," what is that...?
Your eyes...
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Jesus...
Heading three-three-four...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
Smith, get out of there...
Where is it, where is it...
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
That's an affirmative.
Everybody okay?
It tastes bad.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
I'm on my way, Starck.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
He served on the Goliath.
Claire...
No. I saw nothing.
He's engaged the override.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Almost got it.
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
You can't do that.
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
What is it?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
About me? How sweet.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Ben?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
I can't take this.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
The shields on the station should protect us.
What the --!
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Reed?... Sue?
Hey! That's a prototype!
And where do we think we're going?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
What is that thing?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You two need a time-out.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Which was?
For science.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Come on, Ben, come on...
It's just business.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
'Scuse me.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
Easy, mon.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Hi, Brad.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Is everything okay at work?
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
I don't know. I was just curious.
You are a virgin!
Are you still a virgin?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Any problems?
Dad says you have to get up!
Leave me alone!
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Hey, Mike?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
What's going on?
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Yo.
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Poor guy.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
Not if you're over sixteen.
How've you been?
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
That's him! He did it!
How's it going.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
You'll always remember your first time.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
What do you think it is?
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Where's Doug?
Not coming? What happened?
Sometime?
You just ripped my card in two!
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
You better save some for me, you swine!
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Well, you'll find out next year.
How about the point?
Are you really nineteen?
I think I better take you home.
What's your other question?
Are you all right?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Where's your brother?
...I've got to go home.
I made a fool of myself.
Anything to drink?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Killed?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Rum and ice, please.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
Oh, my God!...
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
I have to go.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Can we make it?
When does this thing stop?
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
You degenerate pig!
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
NO! Stop talking like that.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
No, she's looking for you.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
So do we, lady.
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Careful.
I will not die because of him!
We'll meet in three hours?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
They're right here.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Why do you take shit from him?
I'm in.
We gotta be close.
How are you holding up?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
He's dead.
What's it for!?
Keys.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
NO, but I will lock you in.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Hurry!
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
OH JESUS!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
I admire your strength.
Her name is Charlie.
We should stick together out there.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Frances?  Oh no.
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Oh. I mean, good.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
A rich actress.
Get your clothes on.
There've been some calls.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
...I see.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Bye, baby.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
You wrote it, didn't you?
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
See you next weekend?
Why?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Whattaya mean?
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
Oh no...
I know what ability you're interested in.
Is that why you did it?
You're telling me.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
What's left of my blood.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Where are we, mean man?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
You give up on her?
Anyway... if you need me...
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Pretty morning.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
...Is that not true?
What happened? Who're you?
I live here.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
But I want to. I'm trying!
Mama...
But they're using you!
I think I need a little air.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Where are you going?
You're not going anywhere!
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Normal. Average.
You what?
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
It can't be as bad as that.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Why... her?
Nothing. Still nothing.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
I should go. I should leave today.
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
God took her from us.
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Father's so proud.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Brother and sister still?
What sort of task?
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
Professor?
Are you having me on?
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
Now you've got him started.
How much longer?
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
I heard.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
We should go now.
You draw very well.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
How come you're leaving?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
It sounded like Brenda.
Where?
Claudette...
Give me a hand?
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
What is it?
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
What hath God wrought?
Ha!
Ow!
Jack?
It's gonna be a long summer.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Best over...
It's beautiful...
Have to drop you here, Steve.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Twenty-eight.
You like the car?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
You don't believe in suicide.
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
She's dead?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Then?
Why not, against your religion?
To your family.
You too, preacher?
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
Yeah, we got a bible.
-- see this, television!
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Not even for lunch?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
He says you were scratching.
I never said help us!
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
I'm lookin' scared?
What do you mean?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
You could take their head off.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Got it.
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Really, I have no problem with --
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Permission to leave, sir?
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Ah, c'mon...
White House boys want a private meeting.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Uh, question, ma'am.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
That bad?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
No shortage of suspects.
Which is guy-speak for...
You really came back for more?  Of this?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Do you, uh, know...
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
She part of the training?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
'Cool?
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Say again?  How many micks?
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Subject?
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Where's Audrey?
That why you dumped him?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Animal, I can't.
He's not going to do it.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
What the hell are you doing?
Can I use some?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
I can't.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Hence the radiation.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Somebody must have seen it.
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Do I know you?
It's the French Secret Service.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
We know.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
I understand.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
This is it?
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Not again...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
And note the sucked in gut.
He's a miserable twit!
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
You said "the Commander.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay, we got it.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
Yes...?
What do you mean?
How did you come to that conclusion?
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
I am SO SICK of being right.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
What?
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
Are they behind us?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
How does the rolling help, actually?
Clenched jaw...
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Yes.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
Commander...
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Anything.
Okay... On what?
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
Over three hundred miles.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Arnold!
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
The army needs you.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
Well, George, who were you?
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
Let's not over do it...
You think that?
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
No, please; an advance on your salary.
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
To win this war I need an army.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
What the hell are we doing?
Well, this must be about something!
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
They can use their imaginations.
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
You see the paper?
You get life for kidnapping.
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
And that's for the airport.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
What's this movie you're doing first?
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
Get something going there.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
In just a second. Two...
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
Where's Karen?
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
I don't know.
You say look at you?
Why would I do that?
Sovereign.
Get in line, bro.
You're an investor, is that it?
Something shouldn't be there.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Have we met? I don't recall.
I'm looking at you.
I want you to.
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
So he comes to L.A...
You pack a gun?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
You don't even know these guys.
What do you get out of this?
I had to tell 'em something.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
We talk different?
One we're producing.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
You've been losing.
How? By taking my money?
It's all mine.
It's not one of these?
We call you a taxi.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
I got you a copy of the script.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
Harry... My God...
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You sure?
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
I told you not to -–
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
He already knew it.
Whatta you doing out there?
Yeah, but whose point of view?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
How about now?
Fucker!
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Maureen.
Roger.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Ready?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
What other choices have we got?
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Mother fucker!
How much longer's that gonna take?
How long, then?
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Sounds like the hull.
Can't you use something else?
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
What?!
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Morning everybody.
Then why didn't they take it.
What'd he look like?
Coffee.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Who?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Murphy to Epps.
They went crazy.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
Greer to Murphy.
Yeah.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
I don't know.
What happened?
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
It's a Noaa buoy.
I thought you say Tuesday.
What's this?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Guess.
Give up?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
What?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
And what can you tell us about this... 
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Yeah, right.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Hi... what's up?
Are you the one who left that note?
Nothing.
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Does Oomie really like this show?
Hey - why do you have this?
Look at how cute I am!
You call.
I want to "make love" to him.
It's obviously him!
This is way too creepy.
Ew, look at this...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
"Funky"?
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
What? How long have you been standing there?
I didn't get it either.
How about this?
Give me all your money, bitch!
You won't believe it! Guess!
That guy is totally amazing.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
He gives me a total boner!
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
How repulsive!
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
So, whaddya think?
Hi.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Do you want anything?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
How much is this?
...are you waiting for a bus?
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
I'm totally serious!
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Well are --
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
Wow, this is so cool...
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Never...
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Well when can we do something?
What's up?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Talk to us about it...
What do we have here, Margaret?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Maybe she's with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Did she say that?
There is no reason for fear.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
It hasn't been that simple so far.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
That's a terrible idea-
Very good indeed.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
Finish your tour?
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
...one shot...
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
Actually, no.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
The workers don't get on?
I am also liaison between these two.
Good news?
Soon. 
Why so many?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
What do you think?
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
You're really good, you know.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
Maybe I should call Janine.
Is this the spot?
Sorry!
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
What is it, honey?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Should we go?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
You've got to do something!
These boys aren't playing around.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I'd like to have a stool specimen
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
Pretty impressive, huh?
From where -- Neptune?
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Who?
Who, Ray?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
You finished here?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
And pure --
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Ready?  What is it?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
You're quite a housekeeper.
Damn!
I think I should spend the night here.
On a purely scientific basis.
Don't scream.
Great rehearsal.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
But why?  The students love us!
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
In the physical sense.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Nervous?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Yes?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Did you see anything?
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Set entry grid.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Agile bastard, isn't he?
Yeah, Judgement Day.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
Don't you think you should at least wave?
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
For the gods, spit it out!
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
So am I.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
My loyalties... were in doubt.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
The Senators admire you.
What the hell was all that about?
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
What about their philosophy lessons?
Quintus is overly idealistic.
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Who the hell are you?
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
How much money is involved?
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Why not?
Could you do it?
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
What is the matter?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Was she married or something?
You mean the one who --
Elaine --
Yes.
But you're not enrolled.
-- really incredible --
Is it because I'm here?
I said I think it is.
Well, I want you to leave.
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
Let me go.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
You won't?
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
Ben!
What's that?
What did you do to her?
BENJAMIN?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Benjamin?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
A single room or a double room?
Where is it?
Where is your luggage?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
What do you think?
Won't you unzip my dress?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Yes, I do.
Hello, Benjamin.
How are you?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Did you get us a room?
Why don't you get it.
I got a single room.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
What?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Oh my God.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
You're not interested in art?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
There isn't any.
We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Well how long has this been going on.
Man, is this interesting.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Well how did it happen?
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
What kind of car was it?
Really. I want to know.
Good.
Good.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
You believe me, don't you?
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Say that again.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
I am not threatening you.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
You miss the point.
Have you a minute now?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
I don't like your tone.
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
Like dancing?
Oh!
Too bad.
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
We'll dance.
You were very different yesterday.
Yes -- I'd love to.
Why?
Going?
You live here?
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Nothing -- only to be here.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
No.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
And now?
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
The war.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Am I!
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Not too quickly.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
I must go to England -- at once.
Insolent young cub!
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
I mean with the Manchester people?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
What?
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Hurry, Suzette.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
We will wait.
How is the house?
Four minutes past. Please come.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Your what?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
You know it, Lilly.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Not much time.
Here you are! Two rich people!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
All right.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Whadaya say?
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
Sounds like a good Idea.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Not as tough as you, huh?
Up to you.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Myra followed you, huh?
No.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Just a few bucks.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Where's the five?
Roy?
Look at me.
Roy? It this all we have?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
Get well soon.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
Atascadero.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
That's what I say.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
What is it? What's going on?
You watch that mouth.
That's natural.
Mr. Simms.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Carter.
Carter.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'll be damned.
Mind if we sit down?
Carter.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Do you know who did this?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Where are you going?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Why didn't you tell me?
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
What are you doing here?!
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Hey, you alright?
What are you looking at?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Better her than me.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Mom -- Who is this?
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
Mommy, I'm scared.
What is it this time?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Where are you going?
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
What do you know about Michael?
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Home is important to a man.
I didn't tell you everything.
You know what gets me?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
Otherwise, how are things?
What's funny about that?
Excuse me.
You told me.
I didn't know we had any women left.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Hello.
I wanted to apologize.
Blue soup.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
What an awful sound!
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
What went wrong?
I wouldn't drop my gun.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Sir?
Man and boy.
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
A hundred dollars!
Can I get dressed first?
I'm a man.
Mom?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Dad--
"Hamburger Heaven."
Eighteen--  and a half.
Sir?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
What do you do for a living?
Some kind of animal?
Not at all.
Bluh.
What's that all about?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Please--
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
You used to like it stark!
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
I have some change!
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
The doctor.
I came for my clothes.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Did you like it, dear?
Two hundred years old.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
No you don't.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
No.
I'm going to call the police.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Ooops.
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
You have chills?
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Good Lord.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
This is man to man.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Don't shoot.
No.  No.
No.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
Alice got married again.
You didn't even find that out?
Who's dead?
How horrible.
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
I'm only ten years old.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Because he was cruel?
Something's made you sore.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Thank God!
Then who flushed the toilet?
Mom?
What?
That's why I'm crying.
It's fine!
Please--
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
The park!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
What was it?
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
The what?
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
No, I don't.
What?
What do you mean?
Now, what do you want?
I don't know no Tod.
Is this all the display space we can get?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Are you the star of this picture?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Are you Niki?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
You making a feature?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You don't drink?
And your wife? Where's she?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
How important do you think sex is?
What's T-J?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
What the crap?
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Why do you say that?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Andy.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Mast?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
Where is she?
The police? They know less than you do.
Do the police want to arrest me?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Where's Ratan?
It's a short film.
Jake.
Hold it, mister.
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
Huh?
To his own daughter?
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Yes.
Come again.
Could I see your registration?
Your tree.
Okay, lady. Out.
Haven't we met before?
We planted it.
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Eh, no.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
All right.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
It goes on and on.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You look as if you could.
You don't look eighty.
That's a nice teapot.
What?
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
We'll come back in the morning.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
No.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Okay?
I think he's following us.
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
But they'll put me in jail.
Just like this.
Do you think there is any life up there?
It looks like you. Thanks.
Supper for two.
Mother.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
I'm getting married.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Do you play?
Oh, is this your father?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Fifteen.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
You liked your teachers?
Your classmates?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Yes.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Yes.
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
It's coming.
I want to go back!
I knew you'd come back.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
And you're sure it was a woman?
What do you mean?
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Don't get psychic with me.
hound of resurrection --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You are a Catholic??
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
What the hell was that? An ape?
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Who's the squirt?
Got tired of me?
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
She's dead.
Thank you.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
What was that??
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
You better have that looked at.
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
It's freezing, isn't it?
That you feel that way about me.
Alright, let's give it another try.
Lucky man.
Let me alone, will you?
Please. Get back into bed.
Please listen to me --
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Julia!
Oh my God.
Well can I come in or not?
But you said --
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
This is what began it.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
How long since you were here?
You're NOT going to faint.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Who was it?
What's going on?
I suppose not.
What a pretty tune.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
Who's there?
You'd like the house.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Yeah.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
No you don't.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
Oh!
'Bye.
You gotta be kidding me.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
What's up?
Fuck off, Barry.
What the fuck is that?
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
Who are you going to see?
Don't do it, Rob!
Hey, Barry.
What are you talking about?
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Hey Charlie.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Great.
What's this?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
Rob.
Well we rang $900 today.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah.
I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
-- Alright, alright but --
But don't you remember?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
What?
Oh, Rob, shut up.
It sounds stupid.
You won't like it.
Of course it is.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I told you I slept with him.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Will you call me?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
I guess I am.
What do you want to do?
What?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
You know, with Ray...
Laura...
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
What it was like.
How?  How were we the same people?
But what?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
No.  Probably not.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
What's the -- hey, Liz --
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
So you live in Chicago now?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
So you'll stay?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
So so.  Up and down.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
We're not there yet, Justin.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
How old is Richard?
You're the expert.
Happy birthday.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Who?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
He sees me as a threat.
You're wrong.
You did kill those men.
I hope I never get that old.
Yes.
Get out.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
All fashionably without heads.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Stop.
Afternoon.
Aye.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
Does it change with me in the room?
He told me there could be only one.
It is as you are.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Oh please.  Another one.
Something pretty.
David.
You're wrong.
Finish your prayers?
Complete your inspection?
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Do not turn your back on me.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Spare a chair?
And have you something to settle with me?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
He found us even there.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
We have some unfinished business.
I want you to come to me.
What were _you_ looking for?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
Home.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Are you back?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'll keep you in mind.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy!
Mr. Burns --
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Mother? But your mother --
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
How long would the interview take?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Hildy!
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Get out!
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Save that for the Tribune.
How long is what?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
What do you mean by that?
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Thanks...
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Then what does he want with you?
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Where do you think you're going?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
All the words you've got.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Hildy!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Railroad tickets.
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Ring that number, will you?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Sure.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
What!
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Sure, boss.
Walter!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
There's money in it, Cooley.
How much?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Open up there, will you!
Hey!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Hold the phone!
I'll call.
Goodbye, Yonson.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Just one second --
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
No -- don't out me off.
Shoot to kill, I said.
That's a lie!!
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
You'll take fifty and like it!
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Did you get that, Hildy?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Mother!
Mother!
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
What do you want?
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
The City Sealer's office!
Pinkus.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Look out!
What's your hurry?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
This is going too far, young man.
Only till they get you into the local school.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Do you know any swear words?
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
You're the biggest fibber.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Wow!
Boy, that was some air-raid.
How's your war, Mac?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
No Turks.
And what's that?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
He could always make me laugh.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
What did I do to deserve this?
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Cone.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Drink up, it's party time.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
No, really.
You mean John Wayne?
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Yeah.
It's a hitchhiker.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Almost there.
What's he so excited about?
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Should we stop?
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Hey, he moved.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Oh, yeah.
So what?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
What are you laughing at?
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
I still don't.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
That's the understatement of the year.
Oh, right.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Just back up.
I'll go. It's my fault.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Where's Bill?
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Hey.
Jesus Christ.
What about the body you found?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Tell him, Harold.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
You decide. Today is your day.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Oui.
Fine.
That's not how he tells it.
You were wonderful!
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
Very well.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
No. I married a midget.
Be still my crotch.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
It looks wonderful.
You really enjoy my company?
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Shaving cream?
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
I don't know. Something.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
It's perfect!
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
I think he's ready.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Ugnh.
Puff, put the gun down.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Could be.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
I'm buyin'.
Only when I work.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Here, I got it.
Well, we won't.
How do we stand?
They're fine.
Yeah, that's right.
He's my partner.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
It's quiet.
In the gut, I mean.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
You don't need a drink.
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
That's right. When?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Yeah. You must come again.
Hi.
You quittin' too?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You quittin', friend?
How long you been waiting?
What time does the bus leave?
Can I sit down?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Do you always ask so many questions?
Yeah? What do you do now?
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
So why go to college?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
I'm hungry.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Give it to me.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
He's a gambler.
What do you want to tell me?
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Fifty-seven.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Your shot.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
Are you all right?
Yes.
Who is this?
What choice did I have -- ?!
I only protect myself -- !
Do you still want me to stay?
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Hell of a night.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
Are you all right, Dad?
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
What's wrong, Ellen?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
What did he talk to you about?
Is that all he said?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
Did you call the State Police?
No one comes here after dark.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
What's his family background?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
You still believe in him.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
You saved a lot of lives.
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
You still got the Olds?
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
You try Martin?
Dad, please...
This I can see.
What the hell are you doing?
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Any news on my wife?
Where are they?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
How're we doing?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Grey, you read me?
With their shields down it might be possible.
How do you know?
Dick-weed!
Dick-weed.
Was his father stationed here?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Stevie... I can't...
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Marcus!  I did it!
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Ah, Venice...
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
What about you?
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Schneider?
Are you expected?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
An old man's dream.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
Doctor Jones?
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
The Ark of the Covenant.
At least I let you tag along.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
If only I could have been with you.
Rats?
What am I looking for?
Dad!
This is intolerable!
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
What did you get?
Well... I can't think of anything.
Nice landing.
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
What did you find, Junior?
Uh-huh.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Why are you trying to kill us?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
All right! Where's my father
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
What you look at, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
No, the stones are mine!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
I like the service here.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
And then they took their children.
What?!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Primitive sexual practices?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
It's okay. You're all right now.
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Figures...
Where are you,...Al?
Try me.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Who was it?
Who?
Your name is Al...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
My place, can't you see?
What for?
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
You weren't listening!
No they won't.
Anyone there?
Now what?
I want out.
Calm Down! Act rational.
It can't take that long.
Yeah...Who is?
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
I don't like the sound of that.
Door's locked.
Now what.
Just walk down the hall?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
I don't have any.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Now what?
Eat it?
Without your pants.
It worked.
Yeah. I did it.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
They're all in it.
Voice stress analyzer.
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
What?
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
It's him.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
He hung us up dry.
Holy...
Dieter!
I can always flush you down the toilet.
She works for them.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Sorry...
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I'm against it.
What kind of a deal?
What happened?
They have stolen state property.
Me.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
We'll have to let them go.
What Job?
Sir?
What are you doing here, where've you been?
That crazy guy?
Al Viola.
It is to me too.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
It may have been affected.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
When you do...
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Fine. You look fine.
We're here.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
You'll feel better
Joe.
Take the card.
Ahhh...nothing.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
The fresh tuna?..
...Blake
The poet...something he said...
What's so funny?
You mean from it.
You again.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
Promise you what?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
What did you tell them?
Who did?
This business is over.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Now what?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Why'd you ask him.
I know the territory.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Are you alright?
How?
Kiss her you fool.
I knew it. I told him.
Come on.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Hi, honey.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Where?
Three hours.
When's your deadline?
Push it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
Shit...
What was that about?
Sure.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
So, what are you going to do?
What the hell are you doing?
I'm afraid you are.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Why?
Why? Who said?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What?!
Jeffrey Wigand...
I got perspective.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah.
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Give me a break!
Mike... in my...
How have you liked your stay?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
How much would I get paid?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
Why?
You believe that?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Good. But Jeff...
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
You try and have a good time.
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
What are you talking about?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
Object!
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
What the hell is Botox?
He's the wrong man.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Marylin! What have I done?
I begged you to have a baby!
I assume this is on Rex?
Not yet.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
To victory.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
I want to be your -- your wife.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
You do?
No.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I don't believe you have "things."
I want to nail you ass.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Hello Marylin.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
So. Now what?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Wow.
Who's she?
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
...arty farty!
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
And she has...?
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Oh—Mary—
Mr. Warne?
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
What's this about not eating?
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Where are you taking me?
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Who is he?
Fine man to fall in love with.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Peter Warne! 
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
You talk as if—
What would you like to have me do?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
I beg your pardon!
What happened?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Here, boy!
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Who are you?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Detectives!
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
This looks like the best spot.
What's the matter?
Here. Eat your head off.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
You think it's simple, huh?
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Eat a carrot.
What'd you give him for the car?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Better go back to your bed.
You're forgetting you're married.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited—
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Whatever you say, darling.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, by the way—what's your name?
I've been thinking about you.
Joe, listen—
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Yeah, where am I?
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Mush. Mush.
Mebbe.
See that. They're gone!
Then—you'll have to git !
Wife?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
You love them, don't you?
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
What was his voice like?
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
What do you think, Lou?
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
All right, all right.  Break it up.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
You still questioning any Cubans?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Who was paying you, Dave?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
No.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
I'm not sure I understand.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Get a hold of yourself.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
They killed him, honey.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
For sexual purposes?
What's wrong, Lou?
I know David - a strange character.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Where is Banister in all this?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
What are they?
Can I help you?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
What?
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Does he have the marked bills on him?
We are. Don't worry about it.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
This is your money?
I'm not a loser.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Help us do what?
You don't want much, do you?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
I don't think so.
Is it dark?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You're not tired of it?
You know who put the dope in your bag?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
No, you didn't. What branch?
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
With ten thousand? Nine.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
What'dya think?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Want to hear some music?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
And Annette's it for you?
Why?
Will Ordell go for that?
He was here?
I called you last night.
I see.
What about you Max?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
You're rationalizing.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
It'll be more than that.
What if he checks it?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
That's Ordell's.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Where're you going?
Wanna go?
I thought you were tired of your business?
Who's side are you on?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Yes'm.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
We'll just be a minute.
You know what we want.
How can you help us?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
What for?
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
You didn't count it?
That would be one point of view.
I have no idea.
Uh-uh.
What were you two fighting about?
You already knew that?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
For what?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
What do you think it is?
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
How long?
Is it ready to go?
You okay?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Which one?
I thought you were sixteen.
So where did you go?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Is it dead?
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Lemme have the bag.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
It's Louis.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
So what, you left her there.
Couldn't talk to her?
You shot her twice?
So you're sure she's dead.
Louis?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
How can I help you?
That's Winston. He works here.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
What's his full name?
Getting there.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
How the fuck did he find me?
All I did was walk out with it.
My office.
She's been there since Thursday night.
We're back.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
I'm alive.
Let me out of here!
Dream on!
What do you want?
You're hurting me!
You have an unusual hand.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
What are you talking about?
Wait ... Daddy.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I am.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
A bit.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What was that?
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Gee, thanks a lot.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
You up?
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
What's in here?
What?
What do you mean you can see?
Ready?
Jake!
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
Can't you stop it?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Help me! Help me!
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I want to know. You tell me!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Where have they gone?
What's going on?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Where's Wong?
You got a nice tan, though.
He's burning up.
I'll page him.
We're doing everything we can.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
I have some ice from the machine.
Is he all right?
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
It's locked!
What are you doing?!!
Where the hell were you?!!
Shit!
Then what do we do?!
Hurry!
It bought us some time.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Where is everybody? What happened?
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Outta here?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
I couldn't save them.
Did you like it?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Rizzo, pull away!
That's really funny.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Kaboom.
Close the fucking door!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
This is what it means right here.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
I don't know...sorry?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
What?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Jason? He's on this ship?!
More soldiers?
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
What have you done?
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
This is Matt Hooper...
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
The wire's showing!
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Don't forget these.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
It's three feet deep, Martin
You too, sweetheart...
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
What day is this?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
I'll drink to your leg.
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Hey Bleek.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
So, what do you think we should do?
Whose idea was it?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Really? What are they like?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
We could get back together too.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Wait, let me take that.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Why?
You know it's okay.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Can we make out now?
What a trip, man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Nails? Really?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Yeah.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Junk?
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
The Wizard of Gore?
Uh, thanks.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cold feet.
Hello?
Cute?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No.
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Is the baby okay?
What...
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
No...
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
Yeah, she does.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
What?!
Or...
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Hly shht!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
You don't say.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Have you found a place to stay?
Is it hard to learn?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Happy birthday Adele.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Shush, Adele.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
...thank you.
What's your name, boy?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
This the book your writing?
This guy killed a mess of people.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
...and?
You two been busy in here.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Carrie.
All set?
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Carrie, watch for Early.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
You were plenty hot.
What happened?
Could be.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Well, how was it?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
You know what else?
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
It is right.
You thirsty?
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
You goin'?
Man we fucked him up.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
I'm nervous.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Why?
Because your a virgin?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Dance!
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
I'm sorry.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Telly says was up.
The pain. The fucking pain!
You are being ripped open.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I'm coming.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Do you know where he went?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Yep.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
I hate 'em.
No. I was just kidding.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
You want a wip-it?
Yeah.
By yourself?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
He's not talking about himself.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
What is it?
To get your attention.
Why not?
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
What word did you leave last night?
By that time the game will be over.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
No problem.  We're in.
Now what?
You might not have done it had you known.
Feeling better?
Is your dad here?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Has he gotten through to any?
What is it, dad?
How long has she been dead?
Well?
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
He's right, Kathy.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
Another one?  What word did he leave?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Then I'll transpose.
We got a problem?
Peter...
Feel like practicing?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Are you with the tournament?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
What are you looking for?
We need your help.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
It wasn't intentional.
You mean like in the steam room?
Doesn't that scare you?
Why?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
What is this?
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
You.
I tried again and got through.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
We're almost married.
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
Take the western passage.
The White Castle has fallen.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
Yes.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
Slayers!
I road them often in my youth.
Even by you?
You too are lonely.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Once is enough, thank you.
My <u>friend</u>.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Go, join them.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Can't I come, too?
A venison pie as big as a house.
Quell?
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
We meant only to please you.
They'll trample him to death!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
He will come for me.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A fine match.
You know the voice.
It is the time.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
Yes.
Few have survived it.
Each to his fate, lad.
Kegan!
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
I was beautiful then.
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Knowledge.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...You moved too, didn't you?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
No, no.
Rocket launcher.
Who'll I aim at?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Come on, get down!
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
...OK.  I love you anyway.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
It's too big.
...No...
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
May I ask you a personal question?
...Yes?
Don't fear.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
Salute.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
He probably just went somewhere.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
I don't accept that.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
It's impossible.
What if you don't make it?
Nothing's going to happen.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
Walk with me?
From where?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
I thought you were asleep.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
This story is big huh?
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Phileas Fogg?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
Tom Joad?
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
Come on Mr. Parker.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
... My father.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
How are you feeling?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
What do you want?
Coffee?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
Thank you. What time is it?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Yes.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera you are crazy.
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
How are you doing?
Thank you, Sera.
There are limits.
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Yes? What?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
But it's a top three school --
I loved him!
Were you with another man?
I'll take that as a no.
Is he always such an ass?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Where you got in the shower.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Come again?
I'm sorry, but --
You're not going up there.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
Was she carrying a weapon?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Yes?
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
You can't go home!
The idiot speaks.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Too demure?
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Why?
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
The what?
What the hell is that for?
Projecting joy is not my job.
You really think I'm attractive?
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
I did?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Class schedule, map, book list.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
Good. Good.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Well, yeah, but --
You look -- nice.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Fool's magic.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
God protect me.
And you... are you not also afraid?
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
Yes?
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
You be our guest, Jack.
But... but, why?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Shhhh!
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
We must follow that bird.
Worse than the battlefield.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
God's blessing.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Easily spoken...
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Sunlight.
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Can't we move any faster?
A good day for singing...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
You see!  You see!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
How're these?
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
You promised!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
I detest serpents.
Oh, dear.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
They tricked you.
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
I'm afraid it may storm.
No!  I won't let it happen...
Sunlight?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Honored to make your acquaintance.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Step lively now!
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
What became of the princess?
This is not the time for squabbling.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
And charmed, of course.
Wondrously so.
That was in jest.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
What do we do now?
What's she doing?
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Is he a friend, then?
He's not there.
Mom?
I put him to work.
What are you doing up so early?
I'm going to bed.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Atonement.
Don't you have school?
You have to ask like that?
Where's your dad?
I might not stay, anyway.
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
Really?
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
We're not gonna do anything.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
You hate your father.
He's at work while I'm here.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Is Alyssa here?
George, this is the third time.
I forgot where I put my keys.
Because I live there.
I don't know.
You'll have money when you work.
I'm not doing it!
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
When are you going to be back?
Did you got through my pants?
You're too fucking late.
I know the feeling.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I loved him too much.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I still don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I still don't know what that means.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
Because Dad left?
You should lock your doors.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
Four days.  I left to think.
Kurt's been feeding him.
I was parked in day parking.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
Hey, hey!
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
What is it?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Where's Sam?
You brought your kids?
Do you need help?
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I thought we were helping.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I could die.
Don't move!
I better get the kids home.
Been thinking?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He said he heard hammering.
What are you talking about?
We've eaten.
To shave your chest?
I'm helping George build his house.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I can't go right now.
Despite you.
That's the problem.
Do it now!
You don't look like you.
What are you doing in my room?
You could keep it and rent it out?
I brought a few of my own.
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
She's alright, isn't she?
Married?
Engagement ring!
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
I've never seen you in here before.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
What?
No, tell me what's so funny.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
So?
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
No, man. I want you to have it.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
You still got that map?
You drew this?!
Come on, Ray, time to go!
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
It's a pardon from the governor.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
Crop duster.
What the hell are you doing?
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Don't make me take them away from you.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
You ever done time before?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
So it don't exist.
Where am I at, man?
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
I can't take that, mama.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
Wait for the firemen!
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Who?
Where'd you get this?
We could create our own hell there.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
What is it?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
What's Nicky doing down there?
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
You came through, Nicky.
Thanks.
Hey...
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Easy, Liberace.
This don't look good.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
You got the wrong window again, man.
You think I'm a tourist?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Nicky!
Do me.
Off limits.
That just hurt a lot.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
Where do you think we came from?
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Do you have anything special in mind?
Why?
Did you ever see Francis-8?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Who invited you?
What the hell took you so long?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Of course.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
About what?
I'm listening.
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
I wish I could help you.
If you did know, you'd tell me.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
...But I still have the choice...?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
Beloved husband...
Are you sure?
What kind of jewel is this?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
What people?
Hello, Sandman.
Are there any other humans?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
I like to remember things my own way.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
You recognize that guy?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Sure.
He'll kill us.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
Have you partied with him?
Pornos.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
You got him.
You all right?
Where's the bathroom?
Dick Laurent?
I don't. I don't know him.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
What night is that?
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
Hey.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
His condition? What do you mean?
Where's Pete?
We saw you that night, Pete.
One of the guards must have leaked it.
You just gonna let him go?
Who is it?
When he went to work, right.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Who is it?
I won't ever tailgate.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
We've met before, haven't we?
At your house.
Where's Alice?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
That's why I married you.
It must be from a real estate agent.
Same one you were reading the other night?
I called, you know.
Don't you want to watch it?
We will.
What the hell is going on?!
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
They're gonna cook him.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Okay.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
I missed you.
What are you guys doin'?
You want some company?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
What do you want?
Why don't you like me?
All of it?
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Found in Asia!
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Where are they? Do you see them?
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Yes.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Chalmers Bryant!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Huh?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Where is your mad pilot?
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
Charming, isn't she?
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
No porters here!!
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Hurray!
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
George, what are you going to do?
Oh George, come on.
He's dead.
Did I say "if"?
Let me up! Let me up!
What about the porters?
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
The clothes?
was saying—
I guess we're in for it.
What do you suggest?
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
A man whose life was empty!
Yes.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
What is it?
You'll wait till you rot!
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
...touch that.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
It'll make sense later?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
You do?
I wasn't scared...
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
It's a bug.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
what's this?
Now what?
What's going on, Kay?
Jesus Christ...
Kay--
He's here to help!?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
What are you doing?
Would you call this a code 100?
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
So... how'd you hear about this?
What do we do?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Goodwill...
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
I'm getting a trajectory...
Actually, I don't know...
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Wally!
What?
He's here.
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Where are we going?
The other two will die without me.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
Just some guy... they found.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
You don't remember me, do you?
From where?  D.C.?
You set your patients on fire!
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
Kill type?
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
You can't run --
Why did you catch that?
If it's a question of authority.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
She was looking right at me.
Are these all of her previsions?
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
I won!
It's a little late for that.
What the hell.
Oh, Sean --
I was looking for you...
Sean, wait...
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Let go of the gun.
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
What?
You want to bring it down.
What safe place is that?
-- and then walk out.
Which one is that?
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Lamar, I found something.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
There a maid in this hotel?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
Raincheck?
This your work?
I like it.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Thank you very much, sir.
What, sir?
Women?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I know.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
What's wrong, baby?
No.
Oh, please.
I want you to quit.
Max offered to stake me.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Yeah.
So, when's the drop.
Heard of them.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
That it?
This is it.
You bet the ponies?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yeah. Sure.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Spa?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Can you check?
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
We need guns.
He implied it.
Nice work.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Nothing else.
How'd they know who you were?
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Where do you think you're going?
You fucking nuts?
What the fuck's going on?
He wants to see us now.
Put that shit out...
Let's check out the penguins.
All the more reason.
Wanna bet?
Eighty.
Eighty five.
You did?
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
So what do we do?
Three and a half hours?
Hey, boys.
Where's the surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Cardiff Giant?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Yes.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
How do you know it's not drugs?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
No?
Coke?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
No, really, mate?
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Good morning.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Can I borrow a piece of --
Yes. You're going to New York.
Yeah.
Who's gonna outfit us?
Yeah.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
Edinburgh.
Dip?
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
You're a damn liar.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
I'll give you back the 600.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
What did you give it to me for then?
You ain't lying.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
I'll have it tomorrow.
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Did you hear what I said?
Talk about what?
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Just what are you saying?
Did you see the papers today?
"His greatest greatness."
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Another one?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Well, all right, then.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
You want to be the head man?
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Yes sir.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
What am I doing here?
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
Deal.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[How does it work?]
[Who killed her? You?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Do you know who I am?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[How much do you want?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[And I had my men ready.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
And what if amateurs try it?
So what's wrong?
You mean a misfire?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
No.
Potential? I don't understand.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Do you think he'll come back?
Did you sleep alright?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Where's my mother?
The blocks.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Sorry.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Rosanna Guerrero.
For an American she understands this country very well.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
It will be a hard break.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
Hey, Herbie...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
I could see she likes you.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Waddaya gonna do now?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Oh.
Who?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
You come up here often?
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Wadda you think?
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
...and they sit down right next to me...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Sure.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
He coming home right now.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Tommy...
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Which hospital?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Y'all mind the store.
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
We got to stop them right here.
You got directions?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
The bastards outconned us.
What's the matter?
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
You really say the cutest things.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
About that chest-cutter...
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Sir?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
What's the bastard really like?
Did you get it, too?
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Action?
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yes!
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
How much money do you get?
Better let me talk to him.
That's good.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
The letter from John Doe.
You made it up.
John Doe.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Have you seen him?
What do you do when you work?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Who's got him?
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
Grubbel's here. See? 
No!
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Four bits.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Sure.
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut and—I'll eat him.
Is there anything wrong?
That's a lie!
That's got nothing to do with it!
No, I didn't write it, but—
She isn't?
I know one way you can do it.
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
I don't know.
Dinner's on you.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
Tell me what's wrong.
Tell my dad.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
What?!
Hi, Roper.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
You don't have to come here.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
You'd never been out of New York?
You have to. It's a tradition.
You got a girlfriend?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
I can't do that.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
What's the first commandment?
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
They need to run first and second?
We won!
We won.
What the fuck is going on.
How many have you lost?
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Is the hostage injured?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
I worship you.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Korda escaped.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Hmm?
Stay up there, Girl...
Roper.
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
And a car.
Roper...
Are these yours?
What do you need?
God-Damn you!
She said I have a son...
Why --
You were right.
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
It's all here...
It's time to wake up.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
The new world.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
How long?
The maze has been changed --
Try harder.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Who did he digitize?
Not his style.
Need the disk back!
Insurance?
Someone you have to get back to?
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
I wasn't with you.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
It was just there.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Standard, modern, upscale --
He's on us!!
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
Is this... food!
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
You okay?
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
... Nothing.
NEW POWER COINS!!
Let's go after him!!
I'm in!
There goes the neighborhood.
And how do we release the power?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
I'm outta here.
GET OFF ME!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
But boss, what about their parents?
"Basically".
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
Anybody see them?
I am the mighty ape!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
We're asking you to go to prison.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
What do you mean?
When my money moves, I go with it.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
I got my partner in there!
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
Well...
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Inside, they were talking of you.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Have you thought about this?
If I look weak now, it's over.
Charlie?
Charlie!
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
You fellas got names?
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Like Don Maranzano.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
You're getting' 10 cc's
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
What are ya thinkin'?
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
We must be friends, Charlie.
The terms will be mine.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
The Big Picture.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Death! Thank you!
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
I might wake up.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Is there something else I can do for you?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
You know, you never tell me anything.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
Really?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
You mean it's dangerous?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Huh?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
No.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
Sam Foley--dead!
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Oh--oh.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
One minute! Just one minute!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Washington!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Yield *how*, sir?
Ah, now, that's better.
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
What is it?
*No*!
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
A *day*!
Committee.
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
You mean--here?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Well, I guess it's a chance.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Where do we go from here?
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Order, gentlemen!
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Ax?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Chick--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
That's right.
Nice *compliment*!
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
You won't stand for it?
Jim!
Anything *better* to offer?
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Pixilated.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Are these the articles?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
You fainted.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
There's Times Square.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Yes, if it isn't too late.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Well, here we are again.
What's the matter, hon?
Huh?
You're a fool, Babe.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
You're acting like a school girl.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Ow! My foot's asleep!
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
You try it.
Gold, eh?
Is that the best you've got?
How is this, sir?
We'll send for the police!
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
He's what?
Your Honor, I object.
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Newspaperman?
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Look!
Yes?
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
I've got one for Cobb—
Have a drink?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Naturally.
Now, where were we?
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Yes, sir.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Uh-huh.
Brookfield just came in.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
That ought to be fun.
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Is she home?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Yes, sir.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
You came home last night - without them.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Shall I call the police, sir?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
You can go out there if you like...
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
But you do therapy?
What an asshole!
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
Interesting approach. What was his name?
I see.
What's that?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
No?
Where's your wife, Henry?
What's that?
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
What do you want to know?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
...so rich?
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
How are you?
Ph.D., psychologist.
Finally, some common sense...
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Is it something you've heard about me?
Mother...
Sofie...
...How violated I feel?
You feel violated?
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Will you think about it?
You got off easy.
In maybe three or four issues.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you talking about?
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Would you like another beer?
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
Slash what?
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
I'm here for you, Doc.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
That was a terrible thing.
I never killed a priest before.
Altar boys?
My very good friend! What a surprise.
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
Immune from what?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
And what did he say?
Fifty percent.
So who's the broad?
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
You know your history.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
No... Why?... Should I?
Got guts, lady.
You...! YOU...!
Have you no respect for the dead?
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
I'm your sister.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Do you really think he'll show up?
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
She's my sister, actually.
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
We gotta get her back.
Um-hmm.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Do I?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
No one will believe us.
Sounds good to me.
Yes!
How's your dad?
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
They always call the great ones nuts.
Are you with me... or against me?
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Hi.
Who?
Yeah.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Bye. 
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
You sure that's how you spell it?
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
Nah.
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Sounds good.
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
What's that?
Wow.
Really?
So what can I get you?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
Or Batman --
To us!
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
That was too close.
It's time.
We've got lift off!
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
What do you think Napoleon will do?
What do you mean?
Please...
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
About 5,000 troops.
There are none here.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
General Bonaparte?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Bastia -- and you?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Why didn't you wake me then?
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
And he sent you to me?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Oh...?
Good evening, sir.
What's your name?
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
No... nothing at all.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
May I offer you a drink?
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
She must have been in love with you.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
I believe you sent for me.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Yes.
Do you know what you're saying?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Do you like music?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Well, let me in.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
It's cool, but where's the water?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Great moves, Day-Day.
Naw, I already ate.
It's about to work, just come on.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
This you?
You straight?
Just a little.
What?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
Why?
I walked.
How can they do this?
You better stop running from that girl.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
Blow.
What you see?
You want us to give you a ride?
Hello, remember me?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
I did.  Is that door locked?
You alright?
Can I help you?
What's the matter?
What it smell like?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Craig, remember what I told you.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
What it say?
That the big one, huh?
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
What?!  What that mean?
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Where's Craig?
Where did Craig move to?
What you say?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Get on.
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
Just do it.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Ezal!  Ezal!
Hey, how you get out of here.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
All right, I'll do it.
Amtrack?
Business or pleasure?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
You shot her?
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
For what?
Can we go now?
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Yes, yes, I understand.
I will do no such thing.
This says "invitation only".
He's dead?
You killed him.
Again.
No.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
I don't know.
Ready?
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
Please. Something is going to happen...
Cover your mouth.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
You're going to go see her.
What am I supposed to say to her?
Fuckin' A.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
I'm not a baby.
It's under control.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
That's enough.
Any trouble?
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
Here they come.
You understand?
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
What's wrong, Mother?
Is he hit pretty bad?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Twenty-five wives!
He lied!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
Hing, hang, hung.
Tell me a story, John.
Pearl! You ain't --
To see Dad?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Don't you hurt her!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Did you hear what I said, son?
What are you doing, boy?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
All right boy: where's the money?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Now: Where?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Now it's your turn.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
O no! Your turn!
Can I have milk too?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
The first night?
How's that?
What do you figure to do?
Harry!
Get up, Willa.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
What are you after them for?
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Hello?
Bring him out of what?
Rod's not a lunatic.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
You okay?
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Go even crazier?
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Feeling better?
Someone else was there.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Nice to have a fire.
You feel better now, right?
No more fights?
Aren't you late?
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Well, a hat...
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You feel it, though.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
Capitalistic methods...
He's cutting our throat...
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Guest?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Good morning, Your Highness.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
We can wait.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
How much does this cost?
A week?
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Bad news?
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
What's that?
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
...and Kopalski.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Private.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Yes!
I must get into that country of yours!
Can I help you?
Suppress it.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Is that customary?
I will start with you.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
Don't do it, please.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
Thank you.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Just smile.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
No speech.
No music.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
Hello, Leon!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Yes, Swana.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
All right, I'll listen.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Where are they?
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Here, please...
May I have your bags, madame?
Good morning, Comrade.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
At Père Mathieu's.
We could check the tape again, sir.
We'll see about that ...
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
How much do you need?
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
To protect his people.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
McCord? ...
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
We can't touch Hoover --
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
Mr. President!
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
What'd you say?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
Mom expects great things from you ...
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Who we working for?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Mein Kampf?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
He was a politician.
Yes.
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
How about Kissinger along with him?
The lie?
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
But it was all we had.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Where you from?
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
It makes us human ...
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Dick, don't...
Yeah ... I'm out.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Anything.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Yes!
Penny for your thoughts.
And what am I doing?
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Won or lost?
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
What?
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
How fresh is this coffee?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
Yes.
None of that explains your man though.
He's real all right.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Not word one.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
We goin' in?
What about yours?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
...Now that's aggravating.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yessir.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
I put it in, Mama.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
Big talk.
Odessa.
So... for how long do we have to...
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
What airport would you use.
What way would that be?
...Will there be somethin' else?
Is somethin' wrong?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Well... I need to close now --
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Call it.
Just call it.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Tent poles.
You already have the tent?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
What do you want to know?
...I'm wondering...
Half.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Not that way.
What did you do?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Are you jackin' with me?
How is she?
Could I have that in American?
Sheriff, I don't...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Do you know why I'm here?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I don't think your friend likes me.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Thanks...
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
What's the matter here?
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
How did you know?
You don't sound like you're from here.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
I got this apartment with a guy.
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
The Five?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
What are those for?
Does he know you think he's real?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Rosa, so you've met David?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Like what?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
How'd they describe her?
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
I see.  May I?
What'd you get her?
Seems like a nice place.
Jesus Christ!
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Can I have an evil twin?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
No... before that.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Hang on there -
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Yeah, look at me.
Uh, we uh-
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Suckin' away.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's not my ring.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
An' all my meals for free...
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
It was a moment a weakness!
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Come back here, kid!
Hi, Byron.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
You... in the Navy?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Who's that?
Great ass.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Zack, we've got to go.
When did this happen?
What's your name, boy?
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Mayo, are those your friends?
You're good.
I know.
Before that.
What did you call me, Mayo?
Louder!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
God help you, Lynette!
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Yeah? Why're you here?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Could you believe those girls!
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
That isn't true, is it?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
Sid, what happened?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
What if she called the cops?
What the fuck is funny about this?
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
The hell does she want?
That's your problem.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
'Bout four o'clock.
Somebody called you?
What do you want?
You don't look so good.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
That's highly inappropriate.
478...
He's going down.
Can't hear a thing.
Yeah.
Nope.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
We're never getting out of here.
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
What if I spazz out?
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Alma I told you to...
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
Motherfuckers...
We'll all get out of here together.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
I know him well enough?
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
You look well, Charlotte.
Excuse me?
You're surrendering.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
How old are you?
These four wagons must be his.
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
No, I don't.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
You don't hate him.
You were an Englishman then...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
One of yours?
Who's in command?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
Your son, what did you name him?
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Father?
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
It's gorgeous!
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
I'm not tired!
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
Was it Pascow?
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Going to tell Ellie?
No need to apologize.
I'm not climbing that.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Leave me alone!
Let her go. It's cool.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
The movers--
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
I heard you tonight.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
What's in your head, boy?
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
We got that part.  Anything else?
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
The situation has changed.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
The curse drove you to gather this?
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Difficult ... to say.
I know the code.
Why would my father send this to me?
Come on!
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Say again?
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Raise the sails.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Move away.
Move!
I'd die for her.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
On what?
Are you certain this is the right way?
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
No, it's not.
You haven't seen it.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
You can't mean that.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Oh no?  Smell this.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Icarus?
Poppy, please --
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Yeah, I do!
Yeah?  So what?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
What did security say?
Of course, sir.
I don't believe this is happening...
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
What's it smell like?
Really?  What have you been doing?
They did it to me!
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
You don't know?
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
We don't have time for hysterics.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
That was an egg?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Is something wrong?
Look at this!
You have no one to blame but yourself.
What's wrong?
How far can you stretch?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Susie... I...
You!  I remember you!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
What in the hell?
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Just listen to this—  Adorable Babykins— Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely—!
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Really?
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Oh, Mother!
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
I know that.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Anne, come here. Listen—
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
What's the idea, Anne?
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Oh, is that so?
I bring a message from Garcia.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Look, I quit!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account—
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey—  Let me know when you're quitting.
Who are you?
You what?
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
What do you know about Conrad?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
What could I be?
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
No.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Hello, Smith.
I suppose you know why I came—?
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
I don't eat waffles.
We just thought that—
Double-strength!
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Nobody seems to want to do anything—  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Good morning, everybody—  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
But I—
That's puttering, sir.
Yes.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Mary Sue?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
And they won't be able to tell?
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Oh, hi ...
Bud?
Wait ...
It's alright. Let me see.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Sure you are.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
I don't believe it.
What'll it be?
Want some bridge mix?
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
Do you know that it's illegal?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
How'd you know about the fire?
Lemme see that.
Oh God.
You know him?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Who's that?
Can we do any better?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Sure.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
No. I baked them for you.
Keeps going ...
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
So what's it like?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
What's that like?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
Real rain?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
You're gonna forget about me.
I like calling you David.
McIntire's.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Excuse me?
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
How long do you think you've been here?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
You know what I really like?
Aren't you a little early?
It's an art book.
This is Barry.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
What's the listing?
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
It's not cool?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Goodbye.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Hi. This is Jack.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
No.
No.
Really?
...yes...
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Hello?
I'm going to work.
Yes.
I know but I....how much is it?
You lied to me?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
Hello?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Do you have brothers or sisters?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Oh My God.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
Do you want to pick me up?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
You like her?
What happened?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Yeah.
This is Barry.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Have a good trip.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Are you ok?
I'm sorry.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Did you have my home phone number?
Yeah.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
How you doin' Barry?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
Hey, good morning, Barry.
Why you wearin' a suit?
What is this?
Good morning, Barry....
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
Yes.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Yes. Sorry.
Ok.
I know.
So they'll go.
Hello?
Are you ready?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
So...did my brother call you?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
Go back to your room. Quickly.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
Go to hell!
Who's to say I did not?
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
You're a sentimental man.
And --?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
It was not inspired by circumstance.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
As you say, Doctor.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
As for the author... shoot him.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
Most assuredly.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
Good God, Marquise --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
Doesn't that please you?
You're just scared.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Who are you, sir?
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Louis
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
Keep filming.
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
Hearst?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Nope.
Magic
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Jesus
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
Fuck you
Sorry to disappoint.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Hey, kid. Gregg.
Hedy Lamarr?
Is that from one of the Gospels?
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Oh God.
Very generous
You're lying to me.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
What who's been sayin'?
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
J.R., glad you could make it.
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Go 'head.
How do you know? You know her that good?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Say what you're gonna say.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
See? That's all there was to it.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
How's that?
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
What?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Can you see it?
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
What's the matter with you?
Where you been all day?
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
Who said they left then?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
I can't do that.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Jewelry?
Jefferies.
For what?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Jeff --
Hello.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
I can't. The police have it by now.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
I knew it!
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
She's only perfect.
We've progressed emotionally in --
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
He and his wife splitting up?
Isn't he a salesman?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Thank heaven that's over!
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Yes.
Goodnight, you idiot.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Big enough?
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
What do you think?
Yeah.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
The same.
Huh?
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Wasn't that close?
What for?
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
What's that?
You know something?
Where can we meet?
How'd he get in?
What's he going to pull--
You can't protect me.
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
See?  It stopped.
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
Come back tomorrow.
Hi.
Boy!
What's your name!
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
He has a knife.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
What?
Who has?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
We'll take it!
Let's see how long we can stay under.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
That's swell.  How are you?
Why?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
I'm sorry.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Do I have to spell it out?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
It doesn't matter to them.
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
I'm getting that way, too.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
After he tried to shoot you?
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Plato, where's your father now?
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Are you and Mom home tonight?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Why?
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Gabriel, you promised!
He wants... your "sister"...
Searching for a money man...
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
I've been doing good, though.
Toys for... adults?
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
You need a COAT!
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
You sold him out.
Nick, please, it's me --
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
He wants to see your map.
He says he wants it now.
You what...
You're not Nick Mason...
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
What'd they call her in high school?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
What?
They won't recognize me.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Rather be back in the Mountain?
You do.
Do I get a country-western name?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Ash?
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
That motherfucker --
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
How long ago was your makeover?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Monsters in the gelatin...
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
She's using a new perfume.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
GUARD! GUARD!
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Switch seats with me.
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
I'll call somebody.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
We can work this out, can't we?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Didja use the commode story?
But what is this?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
I can do that.
Jesus Christ!
How is he?
Give me this fucking thing.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Your name's Freddy something.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Gun shot.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
I'm cool.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Why!
Of course.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Not these guys.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
This must have been in the family a long time.
Yes, ma'am.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
You can't leave us here.
What's the matter with her?
And this is Helen Carter.
Where do you keep the can opener?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
So that was why she tried to run away.
We can't stay here!
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Are we leaving?
Tell me, darling.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I -- lost something.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Where'd they go?
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Go on, hit me.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
What did you come back for?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
But I want to stay.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
And you're all alone.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
I tried my best, but these things take time.
Maybe I better start working on him.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
How far up the trail?
I said let's go.
What are you doin' --
You're so nice.
How about California?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Hey, Brenda.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Thanks.
Ouch!!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Where's Shorty?
Hey, you left your book back there.
Hi Buddy.
Where the hell are we?
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Hey, look out, a bee!
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Oh, right.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Where's Shorty?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Stop! --
It was you...
Both of them?
This can't be happening?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
I'm sorry.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Did you do that?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
I take it you're not mad at me.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Here you go, Professor.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Professor, I think you should see this.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Professor, we need to talk.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Would you like to see the girl?
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Oh, boy! 
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
No comment!
Because it's the rules!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Who is this?
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Are we leaving?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
No.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
How much does she want?
But tell me --
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
What were you talking about?
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
 What have you done about Irving August?
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
But I'm not joking.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
What's that?
Please, Jacqueline.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I have been at the library.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Not I —- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -— "My courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one — so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -— he doesn't make her laugh —— he just sits and talks.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
But you would like to know where she is?
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
I didn't know.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
But he also wrote --
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Have you ever been on television?
Would you mind?
So what about kids?
Do you want them?
Why is that?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
You're what?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
No.
What... what are these interviews about?
About sex?
Like what?
You know?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
What will you do when the money runs out?
Is he going to see this?
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
So you do fantasize?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
You're really never going to make love again?
I can't.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
I want to touch you.
Graham...
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Loud.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
What?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Goddam right.
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
What upsets you about that?
When did you begin having this feeling?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
What visitor?
No, he left last week.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Fine.
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
What!?
No, but I did.
I was just trying to --
Thank you.
No, I touched me.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Doing what?
Do I sit or stand?
Do you think I'm pretty?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
No.
I would.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
John?
Hello.
John Millaney.
When?
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Why not?
Hung up.
It won't. I trust him.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Plenty of room for two people.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
IBM.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Jesus!
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Well? Supper at my place?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Where is he now? Do you know?
Can I call you at the office?
Yes? Who is there?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
So who changes?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
Yeah? What do I do then?
NIGHT NIGHT
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
But...how?
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
We're the experts.
In a way...
A free thinker.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
Could you tell us a little about it?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
I NEED SOME
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
BRAD!
F for...
F for...
Our field.
That's an extremely negative response.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
What do you think?
How's it hanging, Miles?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Anything I'd know?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Oh, that's tasty.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Are you chewing gum?
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
We should have driven.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Sure I know Maya.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
We're on.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Oh, boy.
You should call her.
What the fuck are you doing?
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
Nice shot.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
What is it?
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
Do you like them?
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Me?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
You broke some.
Love you, man.
She got anything good?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Bathroom over there?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Maya.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
That was big of him.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
What are you thinking about?
It makes me feel better.
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
Does it hurt?
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Pharmacy crowded?
It's noise.
Morgan, be careful.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Chicken Teriyaki.
They're on the roof.
This is going to do nothing.
How do they know it's over?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
That's good enough for me.
Don't touch him.
It needs batteries.
These are D's; I need double A's.
Morgan?
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Dad.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
It's not broken.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Gotta go.
You must have known that before you came.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Where you been?
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Who?
That's a lie.
Never will again.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
Where's your brother?
New record.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
I don't like that word much, Carter.
He was murdered.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Hello, Cobb.
I've given that up.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
What's this?
I've got a place I can hide her.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Why not?
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
There isn't one.
Even the fall from the plane?
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
She doesn't want pity.
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
I just read somewhere --
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
How will you do our love scenes?
For her?
There's... a wall between you --
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
You have to see her.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Good-night, Daddy.
You know me -- married to my work.
She thinks you're with Simone.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
Do I know you?
I know what you're up to.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
What now, Sayer?
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Is it a jamming device?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Thank you.  It's not important.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
--My God.
What were they hiding from?
I forgot your name.
I'm going to see you again, right?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
Know what?
That isn't magic.
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
I didn't know you were funny.
How often do you see them?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Something happened, didn't it?
Are you wigging out?
You really look better.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
And you know what else?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
Someone got hurt.
A lady. She died.
You can see her?
Where is she?
They?
You see ghosts, Cole?
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
...He doesn't get invited places.
Good for you.
Bitch.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Suzie???
Looks like the alternator.
Come on --
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Hey. Fuck you.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
"Peggy-Sue" --
Are you crazy?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
He means moon shining.
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
You'll be back.
It's time to make amends.
Never heard of it.
Ow!
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
So?
No --
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Second verse!
-- Where have you two been?
Carl.
How are you going to find him?
And that makes you look like a squid?
Sorry.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Grant, where'd you go?
No reception out here.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
What are you doing?!
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Rorschach.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Where are you going?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I never danced in a towel before.
Who's that?
I'll get if for you.
When one sees you they all see you.
Where'd he go?
Praise Jesus.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Who'd want to?
But you could get killed, right?
So tell me about yourself.
Is this fun?
You have a great profile.
See ya, Kate.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
What are you thinking?
Cledus.
Also boring.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Loud and clear.
Shit! No one's here.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
We're outta motion lotion.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Oh.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
He's giving them up?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Who?
You're sure?
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Really?
I've got concerns.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
What happened?
No, what did you say on the machine?
About what?
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I did it?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
That's probably him now...
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
Here. Sit.   Please.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
...Does he know?
...Yeah, fifty-three.
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
For real?
True?
What were you doin' here anyway?
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
What'd you say?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
No?  Who am I, then?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
You murdered her!
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
Kelvin, you awake?
Perhaps it did.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What do you want?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
Don't.
What are they?
We're taking a flight?
You go home.
Is it a planet?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
What happened to us, exactly?
He has a point.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
But we fought.
Why did she do it?
Can you sleep?
You're the coward.
You don't want me.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
But that's what happened before.
What's happening to us?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Chris --
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Where did you go before?
How can you be here...
Followed by non-human manifestations.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
Are you nervous?
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Claire?
No dog.
Open the door, will you?
I do care about you!
What do you want to do?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
What a memory.
They guys treatin' you all right?
Claire!
Everyone's all right...?
You still going away?
You're planning to speak?
... just saying you should think twice about it...
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Keep what handy?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Mike?
My ass is falling.  It is.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Honey.  You got him.
I'd identify him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
She took you shopping for a tie?
Why?
Coming to bed?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
You in this with me?
I asked for the man in charge...
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
Why should she come in?
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Under the table.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
You coming in?
And Flash isn't?
Here you go, Pete.
What, want a glass?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Flash, get lost.
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
You get mugged or something?
Yeah--
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
My my.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
Some prep school thing.
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
You'd feel what?
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I... I like you.  A lot.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Peter, you're bleeding.
My… self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Your dog ate it.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
No…
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
What some brandy?
105-353.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Jawohl.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
What is this? This is water?
Shut up, Animal!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
You want Betty Grable!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
You'll fix me up!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
What do those broads say?
Grable, not Gable!
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Not yet.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Yeah?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
What guy?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
That's where he's going.
Are any of them inhabited?
Data, this isn't the time.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Close to retirement?
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Oh
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
But I do have a theory...
Keep her together until I get back.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Tractor beam, aye!
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Response?
Aye sir, coding now.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Why don't we beam it up?
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I don't understand.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
The Genesis planet is gone.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Why would you do this...?
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Close... There --
Gentlemen. Good evening.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
May I ask why...?
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Give me your hand and we both live.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
He asked you not to grieve...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
Share this with no one.
How can you tell that?
My Lord... what are your orders?
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
You amaze me, Commander.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
They even killed the galley chief.
But what if they went -- nowhere?
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
... taking Genesis away from us...
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
You did this -- in a day?!
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
David --
Jim --
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
It's the Genesis Wave!
We encoded four minutes --
I don't mean to intrude.
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
No!
Departing dark side, Regula.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
We'll be going to warp speed --
Scotty -- what's left?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Just barely, sir.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
She's not responding...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
It literally is Genesis...
Not enough against their shields.
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
On screen...
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Indeterminate life signs.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
How?
<u>WHAT</u>?
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Time!
I really must thank you.
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
Certainly...
The question is irrelevant.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Bones --
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
You're joking...!
Fundoscopic examination --
What's causing that!?
How long?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
The top of what?
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Ah, well done, team 2.
"Neutralized?" How?
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Where could you take them?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
I'm all ears.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Permission to come aboard.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Spock...
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
I meant --
Status?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Warp two... three...
Ready sir.
10 seconds, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Scotty, how long is this bay?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Admiral! There be whales here!
The whales...?!
The explosive override -- ?
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Transparent aluminum?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
I have to go home now.
Won't he rust?
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
How many?
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
I do not take orders from you.
What kind of concerns?
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
I don't believe it happened that way.
Implants bothering you?
I don't think they believe us.
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Would you like something to eat?
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
... Population three hundred million...
Counselor?
Why would we be involved with these people?
What you're doing to my neck...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
Augh.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Are you saying they won't help us?
You actually performed surgery...?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
You think they're still up there?
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Yes...
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Isn't it better like this...?
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Where?
What did you do to the batteries?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Captain --
No... the door's too thick.
What's still there?
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Jean-Luc Picard.
Where in the States?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Friends from Cornell...
You're leaving, aren't you?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Why?
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Captain?
What the hell is happening, Worf?
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
Report!
Someone...?
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
They're bypassing Engineering...
Worf to Bridge.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Mr. President.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I believe the operation is over.
Figures.
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Specifically of...?
What is it with you, anyway?
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
We're explorers not diplomats!
This is fun...
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Retire.
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
From Starfleet?
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Aye, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
An INCIDENT?
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Your friends are late...
Aft thrusters -
I always wanted to try that.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Surely not.
WE volunteered?
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
The peace conference.
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Gorkon's own man??
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
You must have faith.
How did you - ?
A lie?
If you are logical.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
A computer canna lie, sir.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Brother. I cannot move.
Why?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
How long does he have?
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
Data!
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
We are losing dorsal shields.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
What purpose does this serve?
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
May I have this dance?
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Imzadi. This is so good.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
No.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.

Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Deanna, on my mark.
With or without the rest of the fleet?

So, human... you've met your better self!
No!
We're being hailed.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
Strength in numbers?
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
And you're not as we imagined you.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
You know I need to verify this.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you’d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
Were we always explorers?
After you, Praetor.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
Report!
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Intruder alert!
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
How long until we reach the Rift?
Praetor...
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
And?
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
Make any money?
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Dashboard.
What?!
What?
Money.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
What?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
In your pocket, please...
I...
What's the matter?
Horses.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
But I must go here.
What is hitchhike?
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Asshole!!
You don't forget anything, do you?
The cook again?
What will you say about us?
How long will it take you to get home?
Well...
I love you.
Help me!!
Help me!!!
I don't know where he is.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
You have no conception of this, do you?
This has always been my favorite time of day.
No, sir. Radar.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Oh, Jesus.
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
We can't let you do that.
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
He has his uses too.
What's going on?
What?  Right Here?
Naw.  She won't call me.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
You should feel like shit.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
Faith OK?
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I always do.
Nero.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Are we having a bad night?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
What is it?
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
Where we going?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
This is bad.
Tell me.
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
Who's Strickland?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Mace... you're a girl.
Take it to him.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Testa?
No.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
You run the plates?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
You heard?
Yeah.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
What did he look like?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
You have the photo from the diner?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
Speck. Harold Speck.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
You work with Koessler?
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
This is a sexy case.
Don't even go there. What's up?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
He thinks he looks young.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
You mean --
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Then there's the other issue.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Start killing people for real?
You were right. He found me.
But why this pattern?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Agent Mackelway?
How's the arm?
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
[Lionheart, what happened?]
I've been to Chicago.
If I owe, I will go.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
No.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
You've been through worse.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Thanks.
I like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
To do what?
They're out of Glenlivet.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
The poor thing. Six years?
A couple of high rollers like you?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Huh?
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
I'll be around.
Well, I should be getting...
...well, it suits you...
Hi. Sorry about that.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
I mean, I need the money.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
An eight.
Sounds more like Aids...
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
Oh, like that song...
Thanks, man.
What's dumb about it?
It's kinda money, actually.
Who threw this party, anyway?
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Are you ready to order?
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're going to Vegas.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas, baby!
Wake up, baby.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
That's not cool.
It doesn't matter...
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
...So give me the fuckin part...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
She didn't like me, anyway.
Don't remind me.
...a day...
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
No. Doesn't that suck?
No.
What time's this party tonight?
Which one?
What are you doing?
How long do I wait to call?
What the fuck..?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
...against the computer.
Oh, it's on, baby...
Now?
...honestly...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
It's on...
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
No.
You take care of your family?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
And this?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Barzini will move against you first.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
What is it?
You tell us about America.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
I know about what you mean!
Ever seen anything like that before?
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Is the hospital covered?
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
We should hear what they have to say.
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
Michael?
He'll be OK.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
Will you?
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
How can you be sure?
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
A million times.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
What is it?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
How do you do.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Do you have any brothers?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I've got plans!
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Marge-maintenance.
Who is it?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
You should watch that!
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Okay.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Are you okay?
Hello Marge.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
He hates being confronted.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Where does Dickie live?
Look at me what?
Very.
You've got Dickie's rings.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
What?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Where's Dickie's father?
Is this you?
This is spectacular.
Which is?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
Let's go.
What?
Of course. Aunt Joan.
You're kidding.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
That's good, isn't it?
Not guilty.
Tom, are you okay?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hello. What are you up to?
How was it?
Was that Meredith?
Why lie?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Dickie Greenleaf?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Absolutely.
Nah, this'll be fine.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
You want to canvass?
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
What hours do you work?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
This is sort of high class...
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Hello, Travis.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
How long has he been there?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
Huh?
20 bucks?
Listen...
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Don't you want to go?
Well, I tried.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
God, you are square.
Why?
What should I do? Call the cops?
How?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
Got your license?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Anything you say, officer.
So howsit?
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Could we change the subject?
It's me sir.
He's got a gun, sir.
I don't understand....
Well yes I suppose ...
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Surprise, surprise.
I believe you.
You've got everything?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
I do?
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
They're not bad.
What... do you remember?
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Are you saying that he's...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Well...
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Did I what?
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Exactly.
When'd you quit smoking?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
It's about me.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
Cathy?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
I was wondering...
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Thank you.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
And what had you done?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
I don't understand.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I see.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Yes, I did.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Why are they trying to kill people?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
See where I'm pointing?
The two kids?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Daniels.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
How long have you known her?
Yes?
Well... well, is everyone all right?
When?
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
That's the last of it.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Oh.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Certainly, but...
I'm sure.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Why did he shoot her?
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
You were lying.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Do you want some mustard with this?
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
I think it's safe to get out now.
The town looks clear.
Do you want to try your father again? 
Where are they heading?
The power.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
There we are!
That... that... who was that?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
How do you plan to do that?
Birds?
We need them.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
It might be an interesting case.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
This is a gift you'll not return.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
I would make you rich.
But why, Gray? Why?
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
You and I should work together.
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
I hate that picture.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Check and mate.
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
Fucking crow.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
You killed her!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
They killed her because she found out.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Maybe a little demonstration.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
He gave these to you?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Are you an FBI man?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
You must have come a long way.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
You know about the United Nations?
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
It was a wonderful day.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
I wonder if we ought to--
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
I want to know what he told you last night.
Just twelve.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
It must be twelve-thirty.
Where are you going now?
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
But how -- how long--?
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Is it worth anything?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You sure about that?
No -- no, thanks.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
All day.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Shut up!
Two down and two to go.
Whattaya mean?
We still going?
Where is she?!
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Look.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
... And stay outta here.
Thanks, Grandpa...
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
You didn't tell David?
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Where's Michael?
What did you say?
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I'm really sorry, Max.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Something the matter?
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Ouch.
Now you and David...
Let's go see them.
When?
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
David's looking for me... I have to go.
Where are we going?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Go away.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
What??
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Star.
What's the matter?
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Where these tracks headed?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
What was he doing in the rec room?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Too damn dangerous.
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Childs!!
Let's open it.
Childs!  That a fuse?
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
MacReady!
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
What are you doing?
Well, who's got access to it?
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
Right.  Why not?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
We're on fire!
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Looks good.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Get back!!
Get your gear on.
You hear that?
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Sir... have you a name?
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
When was his mother taken?
It's what they want you to see.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Vox --
We make them see what we wish.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
I'm tired of running.
It's spectacular...
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You're late.
All right, what is it now?
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Alex, what is it?
Alex, what is it?
We took a walk three days ago.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
In the future, we'll be better.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
You wouldn't believe me.
You won't say that in a week.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
His curiosity is amazing.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
Is he all right?
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
Good night, then.
This is magnificent...
The mud carriers.
Yes... I suppose so.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Might I ask why?
No, sir --
And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
My father has gone to a better place.
What do you mean?!
How did you get hurt?
Should we be...
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
Who are you?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
What should they be looking for?
You done with your small talk?
I need to get this letter to someone.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
[Beat] What's your name?
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Do you really believe me?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
How long do we have?
I don't understand.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
And if I didn't want to come?
You were convicted of the crime.
My God you look exactly like him.
What case?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
And how do you know that?
Who...who kills me?
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
[Beat] How do you know?
It's gonna be sticky.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Well, where are you from?
Of course you don't know.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
You want anything special for dinner?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Who do you think did it?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
I've been better.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
I have no problem with that.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
What kind of gun was it?
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Stop.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
What?
Tell me.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Who did it?
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Front.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
In case of what?
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Exactly.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
It means shut up, Thelma.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
What happened to your hair?
You think you've found your calling?
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Thelma.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
This is so beautiful.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
Ready?
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
No.
How far are we from Mexico?
Shit!
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Then let's not get caught.
We been seein' you all along the way.
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
No harm, no foul?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
I'm asking you to leave.
Stop it!
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Mary again.
Why not?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I don't know about this, Dom.
His mother?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
No You mean...?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
You know, clean the pipes.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
We're in love with your roommate.
Healy you dog!
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
The sawbones?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Don't you want to know my name?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
A surprise?
I know he's around here someplace.
How about -- ?
I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.
Fuck!!
Urrggghh...
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't buy it.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
I think your life's about to change.
Nope. Never been.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Among others.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
You know, I really should take your card.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
You what?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Bundt cake?
An old flame?
Holy shit...
Pat does projects all over the world.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
What...?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh yeah. Fine.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Hi, Ted.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Ted, are you okay?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Now by killer, you mean...?
So you're a writer?
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Please leave.
Ted...?
Yeah? What do you want?
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Ho there.
Piggyback ride.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
The other thing is...
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
I'll do it.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Zorin will eat him alive!
My father --
And?
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
Yeah?
And the second condition?
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Secretary of Defense...
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
I was eating that.
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Let's get out of here.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
I don't want to listen to this again.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Hey.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
I see.
Mr. Clear Moon.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
A murder. On the reservation.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Were you in Nam?
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
This is a restricted area.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
I got one up on ya.
Meet me at base. Over.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Bastards...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
What did he say?
So what?
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Not no more.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
Still after Jimmy?
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What's that?
Jesus. Oil?
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
This Jimmy's?
I desecrated it?
Ray. X22.
X21. Come back.
What are you doing on the reservation?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
I beg your pardon.
Where did you see that?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
Yes, ma'am.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
There you go with those moves again.
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Harmless!
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
I'm different.
You don't have to kill it.
Lucky charm.
That's not what I hear.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Looks like a tie.
I know exactly what you mean.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Tomcats?
MAVERICK.
This is crazy!
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
Ohhh Mother!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
I've got it -- hold on!
No! Not again!
Let me do the talking.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
So I've heard.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Great move. Great
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Something bothering you?
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
GET LOST!
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
Who's the hell is that?
Morning, Coogan.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
How do you feel?
Welcome to Mars.
What to the rebels want?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Shut up and drive!
I'll go encode your room key.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Kill him.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
What is it?
On his way.
Shit!
Why not?
Hey, Quaid!
Are you saying she liked it?
Shit!
He's not at ground level.
Who is she?
Lori...
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
And you believe him?
Well...What do you say?
Harry from work...He was the boss.
Let me finish!
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
I'm not interested in that.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
This is too weird.
I'm not falling for it.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Not bad, for a hooker.
I don't need Kuato for that.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
...Who are you?
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You guys all set?
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, still got one poking around.
How much you think?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Knock it off, Burt!
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
She's got my vote.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
You know, up the jeep trail.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
You're really leaving, huh?
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
Jeez, look at that guy.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Its tires are flat...
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Use the fucking bomb!
How's she doing?
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
Ready?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
I noticed.
"We"?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
-- Easy as that, huh?
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
A fucking wheelchair?
Eddie Dowd.
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
You do.
My mother find you?
Racist asshole came at me.
Afraid of what?
-- About what?
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
I don't think I know that name.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
And why was an exception made?
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Don't get funny with me again.
Let's ditch this place and party.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
OK, Gordon.
OK, Gordon.
HE'S GONE.
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
That would indicate that it's the future.
No.
No.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
Sort of shorthand.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Accidental?
What is it?
Agent Desmond, it's...
You better dust this place, Sam.
Noooo...
James called me last night looking for you.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Call me.
Where are the Cookies?
What are you doing?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
How did the car get back here?
What'll it be?
You got it.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
The pages are gone. That's real.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Did you make me a tape?
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
We're on our way, Baby.
James...
Why? It does.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
I've got to see you.
What about tonight?
What's going on?
What do you mean?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Good night, Mom.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Are you sure you're okay?
Leland...
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
What is the truth?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
They lied.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Orthopedics?
Ed Concannon.
No further questions.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Anything special about the case?
We went to Code Blue...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
What is this going to cost?
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
I didn't do too well for you.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am seventy-four years old.
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
The most respected...
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Mrs. Simmonds.
What did she say?
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
I object, your Honor...
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
Maybe I can do something right.
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Dr. Gruber.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Well, well, well. Huh?
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
So what?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Today is Tuesday. What?
What happened, Joey...?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
...four years ago...
What are you doing in New York...?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Hey, how about that!
There's nobody left around here now.
You look kinda lost yourself.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
How does it happen cars are running?
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Where are we?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
That needle ain't pointing north!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
They'll understand us, all right!
Can I read it?
You mean that was a...
So I don't know about horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
No, you don't.
Does he have to stay here over night?
Like what?
These look quite fresh.
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
In my bed.
Do you have to die to see God?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Dylan, where's the man?
You okay?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Heather?  You doing okay?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
When do you think it'll be done?
You got it.  What's happening?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather, what is it?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Now?
Did we lose anybody?
Looks like weather.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
What?
You may not like what you hear.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Everyone aboard young Bill?
But your instinct was to lose sail?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Fine.
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
You okay?
Feels different doesn't it?
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Do you have your ticket?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
What the hell is going on?
Jesus.
How ya doing?
I feel like I got you into this.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
It was so real...
Who told you that?
That's how he died you know.
Can't do it.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
But you invited is aboard.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
What?!  What's happening?!!
Son-of-a-bitch.
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
Immortality.
Me, too.
Don't ever call me stupid.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
Why, man?
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
About yourself?
No, sir.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
No.
I can't be sure.
Yes.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
What's Cao Ben?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
I'm from all over.
How 'bout a beer?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Why should it?
What is it?
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
That is my permiso.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
You won't of missed much.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
What brand'd she smoke?
In a fire, as I recall.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
What's that honey?
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
I do.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
What was this one?
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Who do?
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
You ready for this?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
How much we got left, honey?
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
How'd you know my daddy?
Oh God, Sailor.
Sail?
Let's leave here.
I mean tomorrow.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Take care of him?
Get rid of him?
Simple? Kill him? How?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Where we goin'?
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Tripp!
You're stoned.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I just mean...
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
He is. Take my word for it.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Shut up, James.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
I'll be... somewhere else.
I passed out.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Who's got a gun?
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Hello?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Goodbye, Grady.
So what are you doing out here?
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Thank you.
He didn't give his name.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
But... ?
Professor Tripp?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Isn't this...?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Kinship. And what's here?
It feels really... good... here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
So, why did you take me up there?
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
But, last night...
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
It's because you don't eat.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Get out of here.
Yes, Hannah?
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
Professor Tripp.
Easy there.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Emily left me this morning.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Not have it.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Who's gun is that?
Who's that sitting in your car?
And what did you say?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I lost it all.
Ouch. How many?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Grady?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
What is it, Grady?
Excuse me?
No.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
George Sanders?
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
You doing okay?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
Ah, come on.
Aren't you glad?
What do you mean?
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
You always carry these?
It's just a city park.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
See anything interesting?
You don't know?
I would.
It's not for sale.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
You walked home.
You don't know?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
The passionate one?
Are you taking your medication?
But you are taking it?
I'm twelve.
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Banished... yeah.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
No.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Why not?
I don't understand.
That's right.
It's very good, indeed.
Try it.
You don't like coming here, do you?
How do you feel about that?
Do you think you're crazy?
You couldn't say.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
You don't know!
I don't know.
Please don't do it again.
When did it all start?
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
Sorry.  Where is she?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
I'm only asking questions.
What else?
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
What about bears?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
No you're not.
I never hurt them. Never.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
You really believe that?
I've got problems.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
I don't need a plant.
Don't be scared, Walter.
I didn't sleep well.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
How you guys doing?
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
What's goin' on, Boss?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
You never did like being called that, did you?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
You wanna know what I think?
I think you were worried about me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
Well, that's that.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
You see where it's coming in?
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Son of a bitch!
I don't know how!
Alright, put this on.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Virgil?
That's Perry.
Do we just leave him there?
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
'Fish'?
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Hippy, you pussy.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Cab One, radiation readings?
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Stand by on the ROV.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
Then how come you're not with him?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
Did you sleep well?
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Shall we go for a swim?
Find anything?
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Claudia, let's get married?
That's why I asked you...
Sandro ...What's the matter?
What are you saying?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
It's divine!
What happened?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
And who is this?
Where is she going?
Don't you ever paint men?
Yes, sir. Three times.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
Whose boat is that?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Why have we stopped?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
It's a sin to be fat.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
I don't know.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Uh huh.
Who?
I got sicker.
I fell asleep.
From God.
I... I don't understand.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
What do you mean?
Anything?
Why do you smoke?
One.
Why should I?
What else did she tell you?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
You have trouble sleeping?
What things?
Agnes...
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
And you're unhappy.
She can't hurt you any more.
How?
And that you're stupid?
How does she know that?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Are you pretty?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
How did you have a baby?
Did you know what was going to come out?
To be a mother?
For me to get sick in.
Is someone in the room with you?
So I could go to him.
Him.
She'd seen him too.
I hate him.
She took the baby in her arms?
???
Look into the convent records.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Something they... that they overlooked.
Larry...
Thanks. 
All I want is one more week.
No, no, no...
No!
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
No.
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
You can call me Sister.
Is that normal?
Was there a priest?
Could there have been anyone else?
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
This was before her pregnancy?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
You hate us don't you?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
???  
I am...
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Oh, Dear God...
When was that?
Sister Paul?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
The father!
Why must he be anybody?
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Somebody told her.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Was it you?
For what?  An abortion?
Oh, don't do this!
Of course, John.
Lay them down.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
I don't snore.
Get him out of here!!
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Oh, there you are!
Well ... come on.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
I don't think that bit's right.
What are we waiting for?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Oh!
Are you supposed to be here?
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
What are you?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
And what do you do about it?
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
Where are you off to?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
That'll keep you busy.
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Clean though, isn't he?
Is that yours?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
Hello.
Well, you look like him.
And my nose...
It'll only get you into trouble.
Temper! Temper!
Yeah, down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
I'll set John on you!
What is he?
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
I don't recognize that constellation.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
How long to fix?
Hello, Faust!
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
He's running a fever.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
It will be.
That must have been when he got it.
Blow the ship up?
This should do it.
What's the frequency?
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
No, thank God... just missed him.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
How?
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
Where are we?
Let's hear it.
It's out of focus.
Not a one.  It's dead.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Find anything we missed?
Still worried?
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Take us up.
Engaged.
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Now what?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
Let's hear it.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
When?
What's going on?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
But I'm going first...
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
You have to...
Where'd you leave them?
Jesus.
'Bout five minutes.
Phoebe?
May I come in?
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
It needn't be.
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
You take charge.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Just like it.
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
You sat and talked until it was light...
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
What have you got to do with it?
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
That's not true!
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
Because I don't want to.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
We never met. That's why.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Just slipped your mind.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Bill...
Good luck, genius...
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Okay.
I'll check with Eve...
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
No heart to burn.
What fire and music?
I must have frightened her away.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I am.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
I wish it were.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Yes, dear.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
Every day.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Yes. Yes, it does.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
Find out.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
You all put together?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
That's the door.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
She's got to meet you-
Hello, Miss Channing.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
You're not going, are you?
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
Oh, but there is-
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
But the raves about your performance-
You talk just as Addison said you did.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
She knows enough not to be here.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
He's in love with you.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
With tears?
Margo, again...
That's on time for Margo.
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
I'm glad Bill's back.
How about calling it a night?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
When you do, let me in on it.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
She's your understudy.
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
I never said it was!
Yes, sir.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
That's right, but I don't understand-
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
Anything to help you out, Max.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
You get quick action, don't you?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--no way--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Carl?
All right, what do we know?
Hey?
--I'm trying--
Who's first?
We understand your problem--
I hate both parties.
Did he just say what I think he said?
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
Goddamnit--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
What would you have done?
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
You overslept?
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
Sure--off the record.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
Hey... very tense.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
You've really got to go.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
I really can't talk now--
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
--what do you think?--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
Go on.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Talk about Segretti--
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
...go on, go on...
What'd you get on W.House?
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
Mr. Sloan?
What the hell was that?
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Good morning gentleman.
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Just go!
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
What?  No I'm not.
Why are you doing this?
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
So you're going to Michigan?
Onions?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
You're missing the game for us?!
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
I think I've had one.
...I've never tried it.
You're so big!
And you said...
Ow, what the hell?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
What the heck is this?
Yes.
Dad!!
Whatever you want.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
She's a mermaid, dude.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
This was remade?  Into what?
No...you...go...ahead.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Let me know.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
About the other day...I've been thinking.
See -- this is the nicest room.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Okay, explain.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Really?
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Merde! Just missed!
Either way works for us...
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Salots! Shitfucker!
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Don't you want to change?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
They're coming!
What the fuck!? You too!?
We don't both have to die.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
Didn't even have to ask.
Oh God. Shit...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Another step and he's dead!
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Shit. I feel sick.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Now!
Saint Severin...
What were you showing her?
Hurry, Grandmama!
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Poor Meetoo!
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
By pulling my hair?!
Come on up!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Come on!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
I'm so scared...
No! Well, yes, but
Do you remember this?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Don't you, child?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
See? The Princess is under there ...
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
I did no such thing!
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
It's an important issue.
You're like New York. You're an island.
Yes.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
He was creepy.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Right!  Where?
Uh, you're driving a-
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Oh, right.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
No, I got time.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Duane?
Why not?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Yeah?
Gimme a kiss.
Oh, yeah?
No.  You're a wreck.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Look, look at that guy.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Yes, it is.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Uh-uh-why?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Oh, you have my body.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
You followed me!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
and I keep, you know, it's-
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
David! David! I can't believe this!
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Yeah, where is the spider?
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Here's a real present.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
God.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
What?
You look very pretty.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
What-
Where are you going?
I can think of another word.
Who said that?
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Yes.
Oh.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Sixteen years ago.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Stop calling me Max.
Forget it, Max.
Oh.
Well, sit down.
You like this house, Max?
M'hm.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Well, hi!
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Uh, how did this personality come about?
What's that?
It's going.  It's going.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
I don't know how to make her funny.
Honey?
I'll change back before we leave.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
He's gonna miss his flight.
It's not a contest.
Can I open it?
Directing suits you.
So?
But she's alright.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Oh yeah?
Go.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
We closed.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
Not millions.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Scout's honor.
Take your time, Jer.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
Happy anniversary, baby.
You want me to uninvite her?
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
You walked out on a five year marriage.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
About me!
It's a shit novel anyway.
Cal, too?
Anyone else?
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
I know.
Has she called?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
It's a novel.
Joking.
And I you.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Please, Ryan.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
I need to leave you now.
What am I, five?
Ryan's really angry with me.
Medallions.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Of course it's alright.
What?
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
Ryan!
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
I was impressed.
The charades.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Are you lovesick?
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Okay.
Shit!
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Monica and Ryan.
So where should I put it?
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
What do you mean, thank God?
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Someone who follows his heart!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
And only you can become a Queen?
So what makes you so special?
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Why do they have you tied up here?
Z!  what are you doing?
I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
Of course not --
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Bala!
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
May I cut in?
ARREST HIM!
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Wear this.
So this is your mother's apartment?
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
I hope everything goes all right.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
I forgive you.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Your phone.
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Who?
His apartment?
When are you coming home?
Your stomach?
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I don't want it.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
You are?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Do I have to?
You sure you want to throw that card?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Are you all right?
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Sir?
Where are you going, Baxter?
How would you like to go tonight?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
I am?
Well -- I guess so.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Put me down for Thursday again.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
You left your wife?
Yeah --
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Naturally.
No key!
I dig.
Mr. Sheldrake?
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
She going to be all right, Doc?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Help yourself.
Where are you moving to?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
What about him?
Family?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Say, this is Snugsville.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Good night?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
That guy really must've belted him.
Doctor.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
What for?
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
What do you think?
I have that date -- remember?
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Now, Fran --
Are you there, Fran?
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What are you talking about?
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
We've been attacked.
That's good gin.
Yeah.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
That's a light down there --
Who's he?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
What'd he say?
Flood.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
I --
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Who knows? Right.
I never heard about that.
What do you want ?
Terminate ?
What -- happened here.
No, sir.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Change.
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
Why did you come to ... my province.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
I had immense plans.
This one , Lance?
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
You think he'd of shot us?
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
You think?
What?
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
What's a big question?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
What if I say no.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Where's your chief supply officer?
What?
23   CONTINUED:
34   CONTINUED:
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
48   CONTINUED:
Let's go.
113  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
26   CONTINUED:
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
39   CONTINUED:
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
I'll go into town with you.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Desmond.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Be my guest.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
I already have.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Answer and I'll shoot!
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
All this for laying traps on private land?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
I need to rent a cabin.
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
What's wrong?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Neff, you know better than this...
Alleged killer.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
How was it talking to him?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Me. My home number is on this card.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
So what are you doing with a dog?
Sorry.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
Uh, Udall?
No... no thank you notes.
Nice of you... thank you.
My son.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
I was going to do that for you.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I don't.
Hello.
How you doing?
The two might go together.
Grouchy?
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
No!!!
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
You changed the room around...
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
How you doing, great one?
Sorry. What are those cards?
Is he dead yet?
Absolutely.
Sure thing.
Oh, is he dead?
Which color was that?
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Now we'll both call him.
That's very thoughtful.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
What did she say?
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
Why are you doing this?
Why?  What happened?
No shit.
Yeah.
Probably.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Bain.  Michael Bain.
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
Five million dollars?
How did he know?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Who is the mark?
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
What does that mean?
Who is that other guy?
Someone hired both of you?
So this is something between you and him?
He wants to kill you?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Electra.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Why?
No.  Just the first one.
About?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
You should knock.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
Ten years ago.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
That's a ridiculous move.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Who was she?
Is this becoming complicated?
I'm taking off my mike.
I thought it was interesting --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Can I ask you something?
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Because it's in English?
But we are underground?
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
Like a hand?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
What happened to Katka?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
What about me?
I can't go with him.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Turned Czech huh?
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
Yeah, for sure.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Will they free me?
Shall I wash these out?
Run into Josh?
Why don't we both forget about him?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
Enjoying our hospitality?
Really!
And the students?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Would you like your things now?
Hey Doug, where you been?
That's my bag.
It's more than what you're worth.
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Why not?
To see your father?
Were you with Jamie?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Hypotheticals --
Don't call him a dipshit.
Landon!
You.
I know you don't want help.
I'm an enemy?
Because I try to be nice to people?
What is that?
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
You're really into God, right?
You have to believe to have faith.
You're not in a very good mood.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
I haven't been nice to you.
People can see.
It's a start.
Like fire.
Yes. But not as a date date.
Your turn.
Excuse me?
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
Assholes. This happen to you?
Come on.
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
Can I -- go out?
But if you could, you would?
By accident --
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
I care for her.
So talk to us about something.
Materially or spiritually?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
I thought she built it herself.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
This is 1952....?
Morning Dick.
What's N.R.C.?
How was school today?
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
How old are you?
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
I think I know exactly what you mean.
What do I say?
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
You mean, you're gonna --
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
March 11th.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
What?!
Pro, the sun's out!
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Professor? Professor Brown?
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
You answered the door!
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Say, where did this guitar come from?
I know.
My guess is that she turned him down.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
What year is this?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
I'll catch up with you.
We did it, Ray.
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
Then why'd you do it?
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Hi.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
That's my father. I got to run.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Yeah.
Quit my job.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
I came in the front.
Is he upset?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Everybody loves trout.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
What's that?
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Okay, friend. Start running.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
We will, old fried, we will.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
He offered you money?
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Oh, my.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
What's his problem?
It's a spittin' image.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
I see.
Let him go.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Barton!
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
How long you been up there, Fink?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
What do you do far a living?
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
What do you mean, Barton?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
...Can I come in?
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on –
Hold on –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
...I just don't know what... to do–
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –
Yeah... rye whiskey?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
I – Mr. Lipnik –
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Is this multiple choice?
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Yes, Colonel.
All night?
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
Take care, you hear?
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
How are you, Nick?
No?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
I thought you hardly know her.
What are you doing here?
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Were you with him last night?
Did you go home with him?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Do you have a cigarette?
I told you -- I quit.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I like you.
Why not?
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
Why does he do it?
Yes.
How's your shoulder?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
You're in over your head.
It's OK.  It's OK.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
You won't believe me.
Do you believe me?
Can I talk to you a minute?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No.
I'm writing a book.
I finished my book.
Did you ever tie him up?
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
You have the right to an attorney.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
What kind of drugs?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Thanks.
What you doin', son?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
What's goin' down, son?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
You think I --
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Why not?
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Homicide.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
How old was she when this happened?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
I'm a painter, too.
What do you think?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
That was my favorite part!
Who is it?
These are great.
No.
Jean, your parents are here.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Paint it out.
– In this corner?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Oh man! Folklore guy – worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Check you later, man.
You gonna carry that around all night?
What's the rush, John Henry?
Good.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
You're back.
I'm your family.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
Hi.
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
What's your name, man?
See you later.
You're a fast mover.
You see? You have someone to live for.
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
Hey, Rene.
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
It's cold.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
What're you really after?
We've met.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
And the truth frightened her?
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
... What do we do?
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
What happened?
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
You buy this "blurry" business?
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Wonder if it's worth my time.
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I love you, old man.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
You're loosing your cool
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Watch the first step.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
No beauty...
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Who's Ivy?
What happened to his wife?
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Maybe they're right.
Why do I keep doing this?
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Al?
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
But...
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Find anything interesting?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Why do you do that?
Touchy, touchy.
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
B-12.
Can't we --
...Not even a 'thank you'?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
How'd you find this place?
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
No.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
That's it?
Joker here. Can we talk?
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Do we know anything about him?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
It's the last thing we need.
Liar.
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Big day today, huh? 78
Ah, Mr Bean ...
What happened?!!!
It's very good Bernie.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Of course.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
But is she gonna be okay?
... in the distant future.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
So, like, where is she?
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
They look like a couple of kids chief.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Not on him, Chief.
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Do her? Huh huh.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Cool, huh huh huh.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Really? That's where we're from.
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Maybe this is heaven.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
What about this Beetle guy?
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
I feel really stupid.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
What...?
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
We're very unhappy.
What about Betelgeuse?
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
How'd you do on the science test?
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Three syllables.
God, you're anatomically correct!
Can you help <u>me</u>?
W... What is it?
Otho?
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Just don't tell Lydia.
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
What?
Answer your mother.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
Okay?
What do you think?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Is this the key to the attic?
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
Their wedding clothes.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
... Oh? You've heard?
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
... He walked off...
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Did you lose something?
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Chauncey...
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Yes.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
I see.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Yes, it is very good!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Some pictures...?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... My suitcase.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Well, ain't that the truth...
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
How were you paid?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Correct.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
No headaches?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
... Ben, really...
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
And look who you brought with!
... How are the kids getting along?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
Good night.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
Malkovich.
I don't know.
Enjoy.
Is the trial date set?
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Why, Craig. why?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Why aren't you at work?
So how was it? What was he doing?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
You were him last night, weren't you?
We?
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
People make mistakes.
So how was it?
I know. I'm sorry...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Pardon?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
What?
Who told you?
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
This is important!
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
You're late.
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
No.
What kind of circumstances?
Do you dream often?
But of course.
Oh, be still my heart.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Yeah, I saw them
How do we do that?
Never heard of it.
Is there dancing?
How'd you get this number?
You still there, sweets?
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
You've got to be kidding.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WILL YOU STAY?
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
You grown.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
They good whitefolks?
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
MAMA!
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
I know what I see.
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
He knew Baby Suggs?
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
I know my rights.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Hey, man, I'm not--
The Gundersons.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Excuse me?
Can we just rent it from you?
Sir, please lower your voice--
Yeah.
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Fuckin' A.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
What do you need that for, Dude?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Excuse me?
Well--sure, I could do that--
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Well...yeah--
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Jeffrey--
What's your point, Walter?
What the fuck are you--
Yeah, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Huh.
Just for making the hand-off?
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
The what?
What the hell is this?
Wooden bridge, huh?
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
That's it.  I'm out of here.
Walter--
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Thanks Walter.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh-huh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this your homework, Larry?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Shit yeah!
Oh, shit.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
There weren't any shots.
Walter Sobchak.
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Dude here.
Dude.
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Ah fuck it.
Huh?
You monsters!
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Shit, sorry man.
Why?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
What about Nomak?
how long since he was bitten?
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Blade.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
It means "bloodbrother."
How do you feel?
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
So you're going to do this?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Pretty.
Don't try to talk --
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
Why?
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You care about him, don't you?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
How long have we been driving?
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
This isn't human blood.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
Blade --
So what do you use, then? A stake?
We keep in radio contact.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
How did you escape?
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
--and if she ever did--
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Inside the grave?
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
What's she look like?
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
So says her website.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Was that you laughing?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
Then I'm going--
Oh, Jesus, no--
--hours before--
Beer and weed is what I've got.
This is a little nuts.
So lemme see it.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
We should be so lucky.
Me, too.
Where's Domini?
Fire escape??
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Boy Kurth.
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
What the fuck--??
Who?
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
Hold this.
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
How're the cameras doing?
What is all this shit?
Why?
Oooh. Oooh.
Women miscarry all the--
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What'd you see?
What?
Finally got her back to sleep.
Heather.
What?
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
I should check on Anna.
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Abby. What's the matter?
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
...Well I'll be damned.
Hello?
...You called me this morning.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...Where is everything?
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
Dead, huh?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Deuce in the corner needs help.
Thanks Meurice.
What day is it today, Angie?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
. MOMMY!.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Shit. You better tell me something.
Sure I'm alright. 
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
I made it go down the toilet.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
. I. uh.
Look.
Who is Don?
It used to make me laugh .but.
Yes. Frank-
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
I want you to hurt me.
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
I asked first.
What?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
On a ride.
Hey? . You like to walk.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Brilliant.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Okay. thanks.
What am I going to do?
Shoot.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Yeah.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Really?
I should go with her, Sandy.
What time are visiting hours?
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
This is it for me.
This is it for me.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Should we buy it?
Honey, your nose!
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
No, my brother.
What type of planes do you have?
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Diego?  It's George.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
I'm calling it three.
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
I did not.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Well, you know.  It's um...
G-d, son.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Yeah.  Nice.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Yeah, maybe.
Money.
Diego?
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I'm sorry, George.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
Just low.
You mad at me?
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Tell Mom, you know...
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
I meant every word of it.
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
What do you want?
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I swear.  On my life.
I fucked up.
Because she's visiting me.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
For instance, something like this?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Right on.
Yeah?
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Read it.
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
No, and neither were my men.
To show them to the UN, right?
Good evening ... Can we pass?
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
About three hours.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Did they argue the day before he died?
What was the nature of the argument?
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
She's innocent.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Who found him?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
Why did she say she was leaving?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
What did she say?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
You'll be sorry?
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
High school?
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What did he say?
What happened?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Yes.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
I've been to a few -- yes.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
Do you think I did it?
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Why not?
Is it against the law?
I'm the photographer.
Nothing.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Really?
Yes -- it would be nice.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Why would she lie?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
What are you going you doing?
What's that for?
You don't need anybody.
Hello?
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
No -- he's lying.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
What are they saying?
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
But Your Honor--
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Humped
Why don't you talk to him now?
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Did Marsh use it?
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Lawyer here?
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Grateful!?
Bar across the street.
Not yet. You want to go?
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Not this kind of heat.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
Roseman Bridge?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Mind if I smoke?
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Then what happened?
Are you all right?
So what happened?
No, I'm just saying --
I would love to come for dinner.
I'll pick you up.
Okay. See you later.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Can I help?
Would you like a beer for your bath?
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
I can't do this, honey.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
What are you doing?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
You feeling better Franny?
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Hell no!
Hey, kid.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
Where's the others?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
You got a nice crib here.
Those 'fools' are my people.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Jimmy, you've got --
I want you to do something for me, baby.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
You know I can't.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
How do you know?
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
Where is it?
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
What are we doing down here?
Did you do it?
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
What the hell do you want?
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Not really to live, just to play.
The money!
She's doing the work herself.
You mean they weren't up here?
It's impossible!
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Violet, please!
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Tell them!  Tell them!
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Shut up, Violet.
I saved you.
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Caesar, don't.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
Not on duty, sorry.
You're helping Rajeev?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
'63 Chevy.
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
No.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
How long have you been with him?
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
What are you afraid of?
We're not that different, Corky.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
I don't.
You mean Shelly?
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
And where is it now?
Why?
That's his brother.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
What happened?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
Why?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
And what if I couldn't do that?
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
No.  We can't risk it.
What do you mean?
Are you Treadstone?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
You are a friend of his?
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Jesus...
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
Okay, so you're a victim.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
Where?
So this is it, right?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
-- just --
But the police --
-- we'll explain it --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
Who is it?
What was I thinking, right?
Yes.
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
Where's the dog?
What the hell're you talking about?
Wait a minute --
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
What?
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
You are late.
Triplets.
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Remember how they used to stick out?
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
What?
How much do you know?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Tell me about Layton.
And you're mine.
Say it was a mistake.
Jack, she's innocent!
Jack?... Jack?
Stamped?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Are you alright?
Yes, of course. Sorry.
What's going on here?
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Turn!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
We? Don't blame me!
Shit! The house is on fire!
What?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
What happened to you after ...
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Oh, good!
Tuttle?
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
That's it.
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
You want to take my console into your office?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Sod it, it's broken!
Hey - that's my desk!
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
What were we saying?
Mother? Is that you?
Uh ...
Whatever happened to you?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Hello ... hello ...
Put the phone down and your hands up.
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
The pace?
Are you expecting anyone?
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
She asked me to pick her up.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
IB Bangin.
Here, you try.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
Is he going to be alright?
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
You shouldn't smoke.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Sleeping.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Don't seem so bad to me.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Who's that?
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
He one of them?
The family know?
Would you like to come in?
Mr. Oh.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
Do it!
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
Turn it off.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
What did I do to you?
How <u>you</u> doing?
Keep it to yourself.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I don't like being handled.
I don't think so.
Hold it down, okay?
You know what I...
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
I write for you sometimes.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Aaron, will you tell me?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Ready.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Okay.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Do it then.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
How do I get out of here?
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
What?
Yes.  How do you know?
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
What?
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
Go ahead.
It's not opinion.
Hi.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
So he was indicted?
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
At least kiss me when you do that.
Uh-huh.
No.  Did he really?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
That's enough.  That's enough.
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
What are you doing here?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Tonight.
It's kind of dark -
What the hell's going on?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
Is it murdered man?
Did you hear what he said?
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
Here you go, enjoy.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Hi Walter...
What's the matter with you?
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Would you pose for me for free?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Yeah.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Go home.
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
I saw your...cat.
Hi.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Hello Mayolia.
It's like...you've turned on.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
You don't have to do anything!
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Oh, OK.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Nice game.
Don't grab me, okay?
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
I... feel.... pretty.
Did you see a girl come by here?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Do you know what time it is?
Something like that.
Hey there.
You broke up with my machine?
Will you guys shut up, please?
Is that your car?
You want some water or something?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Hey, Buffy...
I didn't expect to see you.
Why'd you come back?
Come again?
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
What are we doing?
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Am I in trouble or something?
What are you talking about?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Where's the other one?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
Sporting events, yeah.
Put your head back.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
How can you keep doing this?
I'm curious, is all.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
There isn't time.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
I don't get it.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Why?  Why me?
The mark of the Coven.
Buffy?
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
I really was way way too too.
So, we're stupid now?
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
I'm yours.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Just till I lose.
Fundamentals?
No!  You're playing with my mind!
We lost.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
You should be at the game.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
I don't dance.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
Don't tell anybody.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And now you wanta teach me?
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Why baseball?
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
What happened?
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
He did know.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
What do I gotta do?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
Settle what?
Sorry about last night.
Nuke--  Good luck.
Crash Davis?
Step outside, pal.
I don't believe in fighting.
No.
Well tell 'em, honey.
Struck out eighteen...
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
Ain't here.
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
You were wandering around.
A powerful man.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
...been right, but who knows?
Hey!
Yeah.
She's not here, Sam.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Oh. Have a good day at school.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
In other words, I'm fucked.
No, no it's okay.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
You should say so.
Just say so.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Please...
...hundred yards further down the road.
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
How'd you know I was here?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Okay. You come by the house?
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
...and she doesn't always -
Why not make them happy?
Oh, it's so soft.
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Right.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
Oscar wants you to call him.
With Jennifer.
I had a... salad.
Oh...
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
Oh, sh-
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I want you to let me go.
Get - get up!
Now you need approval from him to go home?
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
...and hypocrisy.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Okay, I'll -
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
No, Sir.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
When I left here with the money...
...I got muscled on the street.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
It's in all the papers.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Hm.
Yes, you did.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get the fuck out of here.
You fucked with me for the last time!
Yes!
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Yes.
I'm here.
I'm always here for you.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Yes, don't worry.
Mm-hm.
Smarten up.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
And this is Stacy.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
They're havin' a good time too.
You must have drunk too much.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Whoa. Calm down.
Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Since when do you talk like that?
That's enough.
Take it easy, though.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
You say that like an amnesia victim.
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
Women, huh?
You're kidding.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
You think so?...Selina?
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Good morning.
Next time, call...
Like you don't know...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
You are...
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
What was that for?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
Are you guys all right?
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
You switched license plates?
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
If you know that just back off.
And stop with the directions.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
Nels?
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
And what're you whispering for?
Lady, try making some sense.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Where'd they take you to?
What makes you say that?
Who?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Stop throwing names at me.
"Theo?"
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Hey drop it, okay?
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
What bank?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Do you know what's in that box?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
It's locked.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
You timed that beautifully.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
What's Nels' number?
Do you think they'll walk away?
Any idea where you're going?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
That's a reasonable possibility.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
I'm handling it.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Five ... six.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Who are you working for?
Twenty percent.
Pass.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
We're waiting on you.
It's in the process.
Count it.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Seems not.
I already called for an ambulance.
I thought so.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
So let's call this the usual.
See that, Col?
He gave me a look.
Saw that one.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Fuck it, is what I say.
See, they get the wrong idea.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
Someone recommend you?
How'd you guess?
You old-fashioned?
You on the game?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Give me that look again.
What's that about?
Piss off, Dave!
He was different.
As different as it's possible to be.
No --
But you can t stay, you know that?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Maybe.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
What you thinking of, hon?
Even now.
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Sure I do.
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Will you meet me again?
Don't.
So I got it wrong, then.
Dil, this is Jude.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
And you wouldn't leave me?
You want to make me look like him...
So it's true, then?
Come on...
You killed my Jody?
Why?
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More endearments.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
You don't know that.
Leave us, Judie.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
Eddie and Tinker died.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
Of course. I forgot.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
You a handyman, Fergie?
Why?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Why do you want to do that for?
Fuck you.
Thank you, handsome.
Hey --
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
I'm not a gambling man.
Didn't look like that to me...
C'mere.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
She your wife?
Can't. Once I signed up.
Best game in the world.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Never.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Is it bad?
I didn't.
You liked her?
What?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
You stupid bastard --
And you know what?
It was fun while it lasted.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
Oh!
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
What is it?
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Reggie -- please believe me!
Reggie -- listen to me!
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Steal it how?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
It's Charles!
No.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Starting with his own.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Does it hurt?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Or Tex?
I think Tex did it.
Hm?
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
No -- not yet.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Are you going to listen?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Mrs. Lampert --
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Yes.
You loved him?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
No -- in my room.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Voilà what?
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Up there! It is up there!
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
Good for you.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Of course? I thought he was dead.
What are you doing in here?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
What your husband was mixed up in.
On the street where you live.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
He knows everything.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Who is it from?
I think it's funny.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
Hi honey.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Not much further.
It was a she.
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
Should we close down any eruption?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
St. Michael's.
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
You fucked me up!
You gave me a 'D'.
I am.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
_ Your father raped someone?
Go sit next to him.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
I got to get home.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
I need to ask you something.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
You can have both if you want.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I said no.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
 Oh, shit.
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
A little early for a delivery.
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Uh, huh?
He could've called first.
Huh?
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I got, uh....
...doing?!
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
That dog ain't mean.
Come on, get in the truck.
...up.
...-ed.
...the ice cream for money!
...fine.

Shut up.


Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...let live.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
...waiting!
...up!
Oh, shit.
I think...
...do we?

Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...wanna give it a try!
Come on...
Hang on!

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

All right, let's go.
Keep still.
Oh, no!

This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
...did you?
It won't even start half the time.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
Listen, Arlo...
...shit.
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Arlo, shut up.

Arlo!  Arlo.

Yeah.
We!
And Brynner's right on...
...tunnel!
Shoot me. 
All right 

 Well.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
You did help a little.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.

 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
...without compunction.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Vaughn.
Well, that just about figures for today.
Yeah, that's my truck.
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!

Now listen to me.
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
You look fit...healthy...
...-ple.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
All right.  After they put you away...

Good to see you again, Leo.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.


Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.

Vaughn.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Shit.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
Assumptions are always...
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
...-tainer!

 

Dead, last time I...
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
I would've in another life.

...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Yeah?
...somehow. 
...tight!

The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
My secret?
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
  All right.

...gotta seal it.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
What for?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Yes, his girlfriend.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
What does this mean?
How much are you worth?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
What's that, Curly?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
In the garage.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
Yes.
The apple core?
Thanks, Lou.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
How do you happen to know her?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
It's too late.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Not that Mulwray?
Iced tea.
My husband's at the office.
What?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
I got your check in the mall.
My husband.
I can't tell you.
For very long?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Over the water department, or over you?
Then it was over the water department.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
I'll stay.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
As little as possible.
I know.
What did he say?  What did he say?
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
Did you get some sleep?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Upstairs. Why?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
I'll take care of it.
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
Sophie.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
The obituary column?
I'm sorry. We don't.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
I don't understand.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Have we ever met?
Never?
The water.
The L.A. River?
Gittes?... Gittes?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
He did or he didn't?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Not exactly.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Yes. I want proof.
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Did you ever see her again? 
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Who else you been to see?
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Sixty-two thousand -
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
What's happened?
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Hello, Brad -
Emily!
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Thanks.
A rooster?
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
I won't let you go.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Impossible!  Impossible!
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Poor Mr. Carter!
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Are you sure?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
Unnhh!
Thanks. Have a good one.
Excuse me, but...
Yeah, but not in here.
She said not to come home until graduation.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
You're kidding.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Am I missing something here?
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
Train. It took eight hours.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
You saw it?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Stop this. This isn't funny.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
Pack of cigarettes.
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
You only brought one ball?!
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
You don't want to know.
You win.
She called me Brad.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
I'm talking to myself here.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
So they build another Death Star, right?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
She's in here?
What's he looking for?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
There aren't.
No.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Thirty-seven!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
At least we're stuck here together.
Pull my laces tighter.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Julie Dwyer died.
Oh, my god.
How? When?
Broke his neck.
No!
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
He made it, hunhh?
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Jesus!
No way!
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Really?
Then how come you got the fine?
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
You're kidding.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
She said she did all the work.
Around three or something.
Thirty-seven.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
Am I right or what?
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Make them change.
How's your eye?
You didn't have to choke me.
Why do you say that?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Like ten after.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
To say the least.
Are you open?
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
I am not.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Are there any balls down there?!
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
What's that mean?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
You calling me a liar?
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
I said go ahead.
The porno mags?
At least they weren't lit.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
What? What is that?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
"Be there?"
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
No; who were the three, besides me?
Where?
Why do you call him that?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
How many?
HOW MANY?
I feel sick.
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Thank you for being rational.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
A couple...?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
It stings a little.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
I'm not out of shape!
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
He only speaks Russian?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
Feel that.
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
I... I don't know what to say.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Dental School.
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Go on, fetch.
What the hell are you doing here?!
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
We'll never know, will we?
I'm going with you.
There you go.
I don't understand?
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
Gabe!?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Let's be creative.
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Remember the first time we came up here?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Gabe are you alright?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
We might be able to go that way.
Reach up!  Do it!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Take the rope.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
Go after her.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Rich...
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Been punished, yeah?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Hullo.
What would you like to know, sir?
You've not been to school all week, son.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
It's alright, thank you.
I beg your pardon?
Do you still feel suicidal?
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
What job and how much?
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
I wanna be sick.
Crime?
Yes sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Fine... fine.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
How are you feeling today?
Fucking hell...
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Mothballs, sir.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
Sixth is faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
You like Bach?
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
No.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Something going on?
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
You guys been holding hands?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
I'm in town for a short time.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
I'm standing right here.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
You hassling my driver again?
How long you think this'll take?
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
You on some kind of work plan?
Why not?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Got it?
What?
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
You listening to me?
You better?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I can't believe this.
Who's that?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
Jazz.  Music.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Let's go.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Limos, huh?
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
You get benefits?
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
Yeah, that.
Head towards Union Station.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
And you believe me...?
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow the hell down!
The sound of love.
That's love.
I was only going one way.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
Not for years.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
I better get going.
What was your horse's name?
What's the charge?
People do have heart attacks.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
That's it?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Shoot.
So what's the question?
Murdered?
You will?
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
You look great.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
What is it?
I don't understand.
At a horse show.
I believe you.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
Blue moon...
Liza?
How did you know?
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
Can I ask you something?
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Where'd you get it?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
It's okay.  I'm game.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
There's no plug to pull.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Is it possible...?
Hope there's a cartoon.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
I disagree.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
David --
You...
You aren't staying?
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
And?
How can that be?
Got a bogey, boss?
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Ellie.  Pulsar?
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Pensacola.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Can you show me?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
So who...?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
You live here.
What kind of deal?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
Some kind of circuitry...?
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
But what about your research -- ?
Someone tell me this is really happening.
What day?
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
How do you mean?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
How do you mean?
You're trembling.
Ellie, what is it?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
What went wrong?
Lookit her bounce.
Gotta have kings.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
You got your mind right, Luke?
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
What you mean, Luke?
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Like I always do?
What's the writing say?
Man, it's so hot.
I'm in.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Back a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
But -- but --
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
I want to die.
When are you going to call them?
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
You bastard!
We'll get the paramedics...
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
She's supposed to have it.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
In jail.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
We've got another one.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Is that it?
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
What happened to you?!
Who's the married man?
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
The lock...
They all have one...
Open the door.  Please.
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
I was.
It's none of my business anymore...
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
What's wrong with him?
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Oh, maaaaan?!
We could use a little help.
Where you going?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Where's the car?
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Do you find him attractive?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
I thought that was you, up there.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Are we allowed to park here?
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
What does he want from you?
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
What?
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Really?
Hi, Mom.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
What's his name, Letty?
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
Tell us every detail.
Oh no.
Yes.
I'll see you soon.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
I haven't had a crush since I was
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
I'm really not that hungry.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
A while, I guess.
Don't take it personally.
But you're checking it out.
Guess.
We're supposed to be asleep.
A daisy for the lady.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Well?
Where to?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
I love the pillows.
It's TV heaven.
Michael.
Not yet.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Promise?
The store was busy.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
How may I help you?
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
I don't think so.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
What are you doing?
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
You what?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Who?
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
All tapped out.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
A pass.
Hey man, you can't do that!
No.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Why are you here?
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
And for my help I would get what?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
For what?
What kind of business?
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Why not just steal another one?
Get that, will you?
Hopefully no one.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
It's not?
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Does it really matter what I say?
Yeah?
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Yeah, French guys from France.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
What'd you guys find?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
They don't have a wine list.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
They don't serve wine here.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
You guys used to work together?
It's good.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
No.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
I think we went the wrong way.
Holy shit.
How do we know what room she's in?
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
J&amp;B?
Algeria.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
You like shoes?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Can't sleep?
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
Who are you waiting for?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
What's this?
I don't care about your sword.
Why do you want to teach me?
You're home late... or should I say early?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
You don't seem to understand.
Do you know her?
I'm tired now.
This spells trouble.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Give it back!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
I don't take orders from anyone.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
No, not yet...
I'll look around and catch up later.
Save your strength.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
I don't know...
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
You buying?
No onions though, okay?
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
My name.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
Well, how's your friend?
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Top Dollar.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
You'll be alone.
That thing is poisonous.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Have we met?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Thank you.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
You a lesbo?
Oh really?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
I never said that.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I'm busy.
No, not at all.
What are you reading?
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Lighten up.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
You don't know how to love.
What do you mean?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
Those are my letters!
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
See that wasn't so bad.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
That was cool.
What are you saying?
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
He made you give him a blow job.
It's like a secret society.
Excellent.
I was just kidding.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
I like it better when I'm on top.
You think?
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Positive.
Is she with you?
One.
Yeah?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
I don't find this very funny,
Why not?
Loser.
What's wrong with you?
That her?
So? How'd it go last night?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
I'm not in the mood.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I thought we should celebrate.
Well done.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Well please leave a message that I called.
She's not here.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
What time is it?
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
I love the smell of pine.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
Did you ever make a wish?
Did your wishes ever come true?
But where did you get it, Amy?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Something's haywire,
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
You're shouting at me.
What is it, Alice?
What's funny?
Hello, Amy.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
Can't you tell me later?
Now Amy
Just you wait!
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
Who are you?
But where is that?
But you must!
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
It got hit.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Hide me? Why?
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Mother! You called me by name!
Let the child stay.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
What?
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
Jennifer?
Translation: a total geek.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
I think she broke the skin.
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Hey, did you get contacts?
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
Why would they exaggerate?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Hello?
Get rid of him!
DON'T call the police.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
Peter knows something.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
Fall in love.
I thought you and George were getting married.
Hello?
I know.
You're kidding, really?
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Look what you did!
Where'd you get the bike?
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Mark.
Coffee and...
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Oh, it's nothing.
No, she died when I was twelve.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
No, why?
Except Mark of course.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Peter I love you too but...
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
We can get a warrant if you like.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
You want her sheets?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
What's he doing here?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
They don't speak English...
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Dammit!
Iím your new assistant.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Which one?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
No.  I, ah...
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
If you like.
Known me for long?
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
How do you know I'm innocent?
First Lady...
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Mr. President...
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
What do you think you're doing?!
... what?
Oh... I'm fired?
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Where's the girl?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
A condition...
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
Uh, let me get back to you...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
You're kidding.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
I'll lock him away for good.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Now he's making stuff up about me.
The Fidelity nonsense...
You ever think back to how you started.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
You ever use it?
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Where's home?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
Are you hungry?
I know. I'm sorry...
What's wrong?
Yeah.   He's a good man.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
Please....shoot me.
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Help me get him to the boat.
What is it?
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
What?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
TONY....TONY....
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Mary.
Where are you going, Tyler?
Tricks...Jesus...
So?
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Don't stop.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Who's in?
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Charlie...
Nuwanda, what is going on?
This is stupid.
Hello?
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
You really think I should forget her?
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
What?
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Visit from my father.
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
Who?
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Noooo!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
I don't know where it is!
Looking good...
It's not them...it's it...
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
Shut up! You hear me!!
Can we use our indoor voice please...
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Man, don't go up there...
Where are you going?
Why don't you back off?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
Yes, Albert?
Damn right!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
What the --!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Fucking A.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
You are his friend.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
You like to call me Linda now?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
No?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Linda...
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
Nick?
That way it sets.
Is he from here?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
I thought you might be praying.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
No.
That's it. No. No way.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Great. That's great.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What's that noise?
Great. Hey. That's great.
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
What the hell's that for?
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
You're working a partner on this.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Kill him... kill him.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Sir, your transmission's fading.
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
You my partner?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Hey, buddy...
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Why?
Good night, Wade.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
How do I look?
You be careful.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
You never want to find out.
But he was such a good cop.
Hi.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
What's that, sir?
But I like the new one better.
Howdy, Jabez.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Stevens!
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
What's the matter with you?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Down, Shep! Down!
Well -- what are we going to do?
Jabez!
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Mary--
But I'm glad to be home again --
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
What's ailing that dog?
My son ... what's the matter?
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Hello, Sheriff.
Come in, Sheriff.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
Me?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
I can't be honest with them.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
The police...?
What are you going to do?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Yo!
Three down, four to go --
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
...I've missed you.						*
'Roy'.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Powell?  What's going on?
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
It looks like a whole roast.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
So... that sure is something.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Would you do something for me? Please?
I gotta listen to it if they think...
They won't talk to you.
Yeah... yeah!
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
Yeah.
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Okay, what do you give me?
What the hell you doin' back there?
Yeah ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Hello, Mulvaney here...
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
Are you a lawyer?
What is it, Sam?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
You mean that?
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
They're trying to come through the door!
What'd he say?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
I don't want him.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.
Hey, let's get ready!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God, mother!
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Hello?
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Cunt.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
How did you meet Choco?
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
Something is going down. Something bad.
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
You were good.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Yo!
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
I hope the block is still standing.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Innocent!
I'll do.
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
Let it be broke.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
C'mon, Sal.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Hot.  Hot.
Tina, you are too slick.
What else?
It's cold.
Be a man.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
I'll do that.
I know this.
I'm listening.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Turn it off.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Pop, stop lying.
The both of youse, shaddup.
No, I'm not it.
But I came here to learn about America.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Excuse me?
Would you like something to drink?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
I haven't seen you around here before.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Just a guy I hang out with.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
HARRY.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
You're it.
These are really cold, huh?
Owww... refreshing.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Hey, where did you come from?
Captain Rob came back?
A raft.
You're it.
Are, too.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
Well, I'm listening now.
I made the polar bear pants.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
TURK, leave him alone.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
Yes, what?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
So, when can we do it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
What?
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I'm not sure if I can do this.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
You said "aloha" twice.
Times two.
Knock knock.
You got the Extender?
Are you going to kill her?
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
This is horse?
My thanks.
What happens now?
Yes?
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.

What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Things have been so serious here lately.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
You know the ancient tongues?
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Always?
Liet?
It burns.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Are you sure this is okay?
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Bela, are you ready?
Sorry...
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
What do you think you're doin'?!
Will he be okay?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
No!  A horror movie star!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
I'm going to my mother's.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
For this one, we need $60,000.
I kinda need it now.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Mr. Wood?!
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Mr. Reynolds!
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Excuse me, Sir...?
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
I got married last night.
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Oh.  Okay.
Those assholes.
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
I'm really sorry...
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Yeah?
Yeah?!
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Where are you going?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
So he killed himself.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
Yes.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
Oh my god! On TV!
Ed! How did you know I was here?
She won't.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
How much less?
Really?
Go!
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
Um...
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
I'm sorry.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Why do you do that?
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Marcia's living with a singer?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Come on, Ma.
You know what your problem is?
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
You don't recognize me.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
Hi.
Oh!!
We don't have foibles.
How?
What does that have to do with... ?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Having a problem with your eye there?
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
What do you mean?
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Where to?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
So Tracy?
I hope so
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Which door?
I don't believe you.
Shall we give it a name?
Three twenty-five.
What do you want, Jim?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
She's doing this to get back at me
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Yeah.
Yes, Paul?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
So you saved her.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
Will you work for me?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
What's through here?
Where are we going?
What happened?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Thanks, but no thanks.
No.
That's right.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Whose shoe?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
Anything?
Where are the police academy files?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
No.
No.
Why?
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Glasses.
So what's the point?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
She is Lana Turner.
Decorated?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
How was I?
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
When?
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Really?  How?
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I just gave him my card.
Someone else?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
What kind of a question is that?
Yes.
Yes.
I don't know what that means.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I don't know what that--
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
Get dressed. We're leaving.
Jesus!
Sorry.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
We lost 'em.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Goddammit--
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
It's a little late for that.
What size?
I know, but--
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Than why can't you tell me.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Anything at all?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
I'm sorry.
Who did you work with to get the--
Stacy?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
You <u>swore</u>!
Stacy--
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Good.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Is it over?
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
You don't know who the fuck--
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
How's the trout?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Why would I--
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
Rachel--
I can't.
This conversation's over.
You're a moron, you know that?
Yeah?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
He didn't.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
Hey!
Listen--
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
What's his name?
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
No.
Can I talk to you a second?
Jerry--
Ssh!
They're framing me.
Jerry--
You gotta--
It's been a few years.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
What does that have to do with you?
What?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
If they've looked at the video.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
Then let's assume I don't.
Now is that clear?
You felt obliged to.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
What's this?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
This is - what is this?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Why did you hold his collar?
Dance with me.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
You're wearing the thimble.
I see.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Why do they care about our maps?
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
How are you?
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
No.
What if I told you he did this to me?
Buon' giorno.
Hello.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
Oh.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Excuse me -
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
What are you up to?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
I mean home.  India.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
Only we have to go to work.
I'll come with you.
This is wonderful!
Kip?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
You ordering chop suey again?
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
Mr. MacDougal.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
You have a car?
I've got something for you.
Very nice.
He says they turned the card down.
We're going to die, aren't we...
Those are my clothes.
That's entrapment.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Let's do it again.
I trust it's your size.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
You're nervous again.
He wasn't.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Careful...careful.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
The big job.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Oh my god, I thought--
Well...What are we doing?
Got it.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You can't be serious.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Pulse detectors.
You shouldn't have.
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
So what are you going to do with your share?
The sign of our partnership.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
What's wrong.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
Always in a rush.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
Oh, it is.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
My friend, you always surprise me.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
What the hell is this doing here?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
Oh, my God.
I don't even know how much money that is.
I can put them in a good school.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Out to lunch with the girls.
You're a girl.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
This is the only thing you found?
At least they made an offer.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
Is that what I think it is?
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
What kind of truck?
What kind of things come up?
Whoa.  No shit.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Counts?
She insulted me!
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Fuck Kurt.
Two million dollars?
When'd they file the demur?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Yeah.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
You're around every afternoon?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
Great.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
About this.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
They up?
Someone stole my stuff.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
There's something else, too.
Who's Baxter?
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
My lord.
Will he finish what he begins?
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Howls.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks at his master.
Barks his consternation.
Yeah ...
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
Give me that!
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Yes sir!
The temperature is dropping too fast.
I have felt it.
Our destruction?  Who?
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
Sir, I was wondering ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
You don't look angry.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Stop that.
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
There's something out there!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I was worried about you.
Probe?  What probe?
Get out of here, Lando!
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
Someone's falling.
Where are you going?
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Jabba the Hutt?
I don't believe it.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
They're my friends.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
The Hoth System?
It won't get through the blockade.
Cuervo...?
Give it.
He's... near.
I need a favor.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
I said pull over.
Not yet.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
Snake - what is it?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
All of us?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
Guenevere...
At your service, sir.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
What is this place, Merlin?
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Very well. Climb up.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
No, no, of course not. You are young...
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
What honey?
You're convinced that it's genuine.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Didn't who tell me?
I'm gonna miss you.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Oh, she'd love it.
Rats?
There is nothing.
Is it coming out Willie?
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Pretty close?
He didn't mention?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Have you told him what's happening?
What kind of stuff?
Where?
Wait a minute you need two.
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain who?
Who's Captain Howdy?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Regan, why are you reading that?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
People get tired.
What are you doing here?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
You just missed them.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
Where's Regan?
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
No.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Save your servant
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
What is it?
Have we met?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
...look down in pity...
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Are you comfortable Regan?
How old are you?
Who is it?
Give me the keys!
What's this?
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Trunks?
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Honey ...
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Count it.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
So we on tomorrow night?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
What d'ya got?
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
Seeing anyone in particular?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
No, I mean it.
We gotta go, Jack.
This time you gotta go.
You gotta go.
So what'd we get her?
What's with Charlie?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
So you'll come out, right?
Nice, huh?
What was it like?
A gust of wind killed him.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
Jack.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
You're getting cold feet about this.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Where the hell is she?
You hit me.
See anything?
Make it collect.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
Have some more wine, Frank.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
You leaving that on?
All night?
What's the matter with you?
How's it coming?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Expensive hangover.
April.
A useless talent.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
Cancel, Frank.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
What's it for?
What?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
I didn't hear you come in.
Right.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
So what'd you think?
The audience was a little off tonight.
You sure?
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
You're an hour and a half late.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Ready?
What's the problem?
What-?
Where's your dress?
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Nine!
They're tight.
Fucking.
Jack, you with us?
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
Great?
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Brought it.
Thanks.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
All right.  Hold on.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
And you don't?
You miss him, don't you?
Fucking.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Forget it.
So why's he do it?
Can't sleep?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
Nina?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Yeah... No.
You can always get another girl.
So ... ?
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Ivory.
From Hurley's?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
You mean if I get sick?
What did he do?
He's lying.
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
No.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
You'll what?
Clarissa left those here.
When did you start smoking?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
You merciless bastard!
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
You'd have to start immediately.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
-- what?
You're wearing your suit --
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
I'll deal with her later.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
Jack, are you okay?
Rise...and...shine...!
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
What am I saying?  You don’t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  Is that you?
Damn...
She said that?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
So Jack, it’s your wife’s birthday, got anything to say to her?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Yeah?  What do you need?
You just said everyone needs something.
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You’re making a business deal...
You?  What about me?  I’m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
It’s a glimpse, Jacko.
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Where were you?
Why not?
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Hello!
Hey!  I was watching that!
How can you do that?
How was the game, honey?
You mean this chocolate cake?
Say it, Jack...
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Maybe I should wait...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Are you out of your mind?
Kate...
I'm sorry...
You’re moving...
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
I need you, tiger..
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
That’s totally see through...
I can't take this.
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Where...where am I?
I'll be watching over you.
Ben?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
You look like an eighties rock band.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
You're hot!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
Stop it.
Sweet.
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
What?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
I can...make it work.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
What are you doing?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Where do we stand?
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
I know that. But what's the maximum?
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
What're you getting at?
Benes... What the devil happened?
-- and why we need you.
Listen...the Heart.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
You must carry spare parts --
Thank you for saving my life.
Doctor, what's wrong?
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
We can't take a second more.
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
Don't tell me they're refueling...
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
There it is!
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
The Wall's transparent...
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
This is a new car, then, sir?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
She started shrieking, you know.
One of us pays the other for half.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Huh?
Well, okay, it's -
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
...Who's Jean?
...Blood has been shed.
Three people. In Brainerd.
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
They can really take over, that's for sure.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Yah.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
Yah, but -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Yah, how much money was that?
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Shep said 8:30.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Stan Grossman called.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
No kiddin'?
Stan and I're okay.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Hiya, Lou.
Where is everybody?
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
...Well, that passed.
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You look in his citation book?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Yah.
Yah, that's me.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Nope.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Linda Cooksey?
Sorry - didn't copy.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Whose car?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
...So?
Your mallard?
It's just the three cent.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
That wouldn't interest you.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
It becomes an addiction.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I want that.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
I don't know ...
I think everything's okay here.
Uh ... nah.
You... don't have to... leave.
I don't know.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
He's not here.
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Marla...
I'm sorry, I...
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Marla...
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Tyler...
Why are you doing this?
What happened... ?
Who did this to you?
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
I don't... think so.
Yeah.
No, I...
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
I don't know about this.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
You?
You're okay with this?
Promise you won't.
Huh?
What is this place?
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
We don't need him...
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
I feel sick.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
Four in Milwaukee.
Why do people think anything?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
You have jobs.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
I'm pulling the green wire.
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Excuse me?
Abort the plan.
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Did you hear what I just said?!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Animals.
Yeah, how?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
No!  It can't be.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
I'm not sure I understand.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What?
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
This is cheery.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Mom?
It's only the end of June.
That... him?
Most kids do, I guess.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Stop the car!
You know what to do.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
What's that?
Wow!
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
Gettin' old, huh?
You read me, Brewer?
You okay?
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
I've seen worse places.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
What's this stuff on the rice?
What's she saying?
What's that?
It's a guy in a cage.
Roundeye.
Are they going to torture us?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Look, Co...
You pathetic scum.
What's the job?
Why me?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
All this is for us?
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
How long before you're fully on line?
Take your time.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
This your stuff?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
What did you want?
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
No really..I can't.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
<u>What</u>!
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
Can I have my desk please.
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
He's not a moron.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What are you two up to?
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
I wanna go...Just let me go...
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Remember. One chorus and out.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
A list.
Now what?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Please don't hurt me?
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
No... thanks... Listen --
<u>What</u>?!
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Parry.
Do you follow her every day?
What's her name?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Parry...
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
.....What are you doing?
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
Parry Parry?
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Excuse me...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Well, id'n that nice.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Is it my turn again?
You just going to sit there?
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Rayette.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Bobby...
Come on.
Sure you don't want anything?
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
What's your name?
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
Well...
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
No substitutions.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
I don't make the rules.
Wasn't it, ladies?
Robert Eroica...
You always do this to me.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Maybe you better stay, then.
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Look at that.
It's none of your business!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
Bye, now.
What have you been doing since then?
Yes, intentionally.
Swimming?
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
Serious, that's what's important to you?
Where are you going?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
That'll make you happy.
Four or five years.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
What kind of doggy is that?
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
I don't think that's true.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
What?
So watcha doin'?
So what's her name?
So what you think of me?
Who gives!
Wussup?
Why?
Fa what?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Like this?
Who?
My friend told me she lived around here.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
I know how ta get him back if you want.
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Hey, what are you doing?
You're lucky.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
So where do you know Alan from?
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Two bs?
Mrs. Smith.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
For sure?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
My pleasure.
The two surfer boys?
Thought so. What for?
You gonna nail the chief?
You're in the Records Room.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
That's it.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
Sure you did.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
That's Brazil.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Alan Stanwyk.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
A .357.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Do you have a passport?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Thanks.
Cute young thing, too.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
That's a strange combination.
What's he doing in Utah?
Who is it?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Why'd you let me in?
Thanks for the great time.
So?
What are you talking about?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
What's wrong, Gail?
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Don't worry, I can take it.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Muchas gracias.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
No wonder.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
What did you want under the bed?
Who?
Gummy and two cops...
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Just give me a hint, all right?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
Fletch, you want an apology?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
That was close...
You wish.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
So what about this watch?
How'd you get this from her?
Ah, an obvious choice.
Hello, Ford...
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
What an interface!
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Zuzu, wake up...
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Nice left you got there, jerk.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
So, did you find my dad?
Yeah, go on...
It's me.
What are you running from?
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Two words.  Disco Express.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Polo.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
You'd said something about proof...
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Hi, private eye guy!
So...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
B.O.C.A.
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Did you pick up the car?
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Comment va-t-elle?
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Are you sure it is dead?
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
It's beautiful.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
Yeah!
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
No, you?
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
What about Sal?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Same car.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
You're shitting me!
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
How about a little of the King?
Where's Johnny?
You give him his drops?
I love you, Bud.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
No, I don't.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
You ready?
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
You call your son Little Chief?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
No wait, don't go!
What?
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
I'll be damned.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Yeah, you betcha.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
John.  John, you all right?
Huh?
I better give you my address then.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
You're not looking too good.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
She makes ten.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Which means he probably knew her.
Got a minute?
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
Hell-
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
What're you doing?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
I'm a slow eater.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
Come on down!
What's this?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
What do you mean?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
Hi.
Are they following us?
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
I never said you were "nothing".
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Never should've let her play.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
What?
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
There...Ya happy?
Why?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
But what if they try and scare us?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
What's goin' on?
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
What's the problem here?
Maybe you should be moving on.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Tell me!
Lock this asshole up.
Why didn't you tell me?
Does he know about what happened?
Are you crazy?!
Oh, my dear God...
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
A major prick.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
Tell me.
Right.
Where's the radio?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
What are you doing??
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What a beautiful day.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Everything okay?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
I got you a present.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
I used to drive a taxi.
I opened thousands of brains.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Crosstown.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Guys ready to order?
Elliot?
Very dangerous.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
You say we go?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
What do you mean?
This could be it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
What about her?
She died.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
It's your best play, Nicky.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Is it?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Why won't you tell me your name?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
What do we want?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
What else?
And you've been extremely patient.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Who is it?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
You're a family man, Frankie?
It's a complicated subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Then say it.
They're my team.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
Postpone. We have every right.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Mine was cobalt blue.
And the Father replies?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Please! You're being foolish!
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
Enough.
Just an admirer...
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
You mean Gandhi?
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
You've done me a great service.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Are you going to walk all the way?
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
Who is that young man?
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
The fools!  Sorry...
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Assuming we are in agreement?
Could we cut all news off? I know --
How much extra?
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
From what budget?
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
What about this?
You wish.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
Let's get out of here.
Call German.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Again?
Everybody goes there.
Will you be okay?
How are you, Jerome?
Why have you done this?
Thank you.
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Hugo!  I've found him!
No bother.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Does it have a name?
I envy you, Jerome.
So you didn't do it after all.
Why are we leaving?
What about the car?
Who are they?
--when you go away.
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
The doctor will give you something.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
That's your problem.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Where do you want to go?
It doesn't look like that.
How does it taste?
Boring.
$250,000 right off the top.
I didn't. I just waited.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
What about the bank?
They checked in.
Do you trust him?
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
A man helped me open it...
He must have.
There better be a guy with the
I'll bet you can.
What do you want to do?
Do you mean that?
What?
Only one car.
We're going to make it.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
We got this far.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Yeah.
You okay?
How long before this car's hot?
Are we going to make it?
No, I'm not.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Gonna knock down a wall?
Suit yourself.
Two.
How's Mama and the kids?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
Two years.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
What do you want?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Jack?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
We went about together.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
I want to give you an Oscar.
Did my brother Frank find out?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Have another?
Oh, what you doing now?
Where you going to live, then?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Where would I find him?
What you having, Jack?
Nowt.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
I'm staying with a friend.
Are you a traveller?
Is he staying the night?
What you going to do?
Did you sleep well?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Polacks and deadbeats.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
You ever get 'em?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They did.
They did.
We're stuck with this...
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
You build it!
...you're absolutely right.
Yes.
What could somebody get for them?
How many leads have we got?
As an idea.
Did I say that?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
Yes.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Fine.
I, you know, they should be insured.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I can't close 'em.
It is dead.
Everything I...you know...
He said he filed...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
A waste of time?  Why?
The cops?
Did they catch...?
Did the leads come in yet?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
What?
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Would you excuse us, please...?
Who told you...?
You have a problem?
Mr. Levene...?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
Shelly...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
...you talk to Murray...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
Of what?
Now?  Now?
I wish I could.
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
Get 'em to me!
Mmm.
Excuse me...
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
Abso...
I've got the check...
They took the leads?
How was it...?
I wanted to speak with you about...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
The monthly interview...?
What?
I'm sorry...?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Yes.
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
I've got to talk to you...
Who did she call?
I don't understand.
What would have elapsed?
No, Jim.
I'm...
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
You cashed the check?
Fuckin' asshole.
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
It went down.  I filed it.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Yes.
Did you like your party?
Why do you have to go?
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Goddamn bitch.
I don't want to stay here...
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
I understand...
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
I never met them.
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
Will you tell him?
Goddamn it, where were you?
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
They can come in now.
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Is he related to the witness?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Yes.
How's the baby?
Does it feel like a boy?
Where?
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You said you were Klingman.
You're a considerate young man.
However I can help you...
Nothing is more important.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
I want you to settle on their terms.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
Rosato, where's your brother?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
You want a war?
I'm talking about Italians!
He supports me.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
What're you talking about?
You ever been married, Hanna?
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Sorry.  Not today.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
Everybody has stories to tell.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
I suppose you'd like the top down.
Who's that?
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Do you mind?
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
No.  It won't do.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
You coming, Boone?
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
Does the yardman come today?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
You're serious.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
You didn't?
My monsters?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Sound it out for me.
Get out --
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You'll leave -- ?
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
What do you want from me?
What's this -- ?
I guess ...
okay ...
What's the matter?
You ever feel bad about any of this?
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
Why didn't you tell me?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Hey, Kip ...
You all right -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
Hey, you want something to eat ?
You?
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Come here --
Toby...
You boost her -- ?
Shit ...
He give you an advance -- ?
You know of one -- ?
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
"Mitch?"
And here I am...
What kind of trouble -- ?
And you got some Italians -- ?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
You mentioned that in your letters
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
Hear you roar ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
Where to -- ?
What are you doing... ?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
This time it's for real?
You remember Junie?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
How come ... ?
You know what you got here?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
What're you doing? What about the car?
Go inside. I'll be right there.
My bag. My bag.
I don't care. Something's going on.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Then you're safer in here.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Keep 'em coming.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
Give'm a drink.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I better call again.
It's a fait accompli?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
I hate to do dishes.
Are you okay? What happened?
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
You and Morgan throw?
You're kiddin' me.
What class?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
WILL!
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
How much money you got?
I'm not sure--
You want us to give you cash right now?
What class did you say that was?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Where is it touching you?
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
Okay. How?
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
What's that?
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Get out, Will.
No.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Then don't set up any more meetings.
Will.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Yes.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Good to meet you.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Can we do it at my office?
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Jobs doing what?
He married his cousin.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
Oh, come on, Sean--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Where're you going?
I got one of those too.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
I might understand that.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Yeah, I read those.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Crayons?
What is?
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
Watch your mouth.
No.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
Do you think you're alone?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
You want to read it?
I know.
I know.
Five minutes.
Yeah?
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
Free?
I have twelve big brothers.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
I've never seen your place.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Just for fun?
Will? Are you awake?
I know. I just do.
Why not?
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Yeah.
Take care.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Will ya look at her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Any gas?
I didn't see nothin'.
So long.
Women?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
That's the way it is.
Government.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
That cut you got?
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
What's the matter? What's happened?
Been doin' a job?
Get to what?
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
How 'bout Granma?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
We gonna live here?
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
How 'bout it?
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Know where we're a-goin'?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Got any more, Ma?
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
Looks like you done it.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
You people looking for work?
Yes, sir.
--Stop it--
Remember high school?
What am I gonna do?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Jesus...
So you eat-- read it everyday?
How long has it been?
You met people.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Shoulda brought my gun.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Not the other way around...?
Is it something you've done?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
I was leaving.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
You know where I live?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
What else? Say more.
What do you want?
Like a union?
Thank you, no.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Well?
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
What's a revival tent?
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Debi's house.
No. You drove us here.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
This is Annie MacLean.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Doesn't matter.
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Poor thing.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
How did you meet her?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
What?
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Oh. You didn't tell me.
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
He's still sitting in that damn field.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Started what?
Who's going to want me now?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
What about Grace?
I'm sorry.
What did he say?
You've got to stop doing that?
How was the dinner?
Why did you go?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
What choice!!?
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
What was it like?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Of course not.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Ha...
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
When you figure on branding?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
Why do you always wear that hat?
I wouldn't let happen.
What does she do?
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
I can't... not yet...
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
You want to watch some television?
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
Long enough.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Let's keep her.
She's rabid, but cute.
What?
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Ta-da!
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
One-handed!
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Yeah?
Who's that?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Shit! Come on!
Crash Override.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Yes!
What the hell are you doing?
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Name your stakes.
And you have to smile.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
How?
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
You look good in a dress.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
What is he doing in here?
Phreak?
What the hell was that all about?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Are you two okay?
You think she stands a chance?
Is there another key?
Shit!
Why not?
Honey, I don't think their home.
We should call the fire department.
I do.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
It's been eleven months.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Jamie, what happened?
Rachel come on.
Rachel!
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
Hi Rachel.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't come on too strong.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Do you?
Something?
This is starting to spook me.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Sort of.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
What?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
It's been totally charted.
Sure.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Look.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I've already lost it.
You still spooked?
Probably Mister Riddle.
What's the pumpkin for?
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Wait a minute here...
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Sure...
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Yes, I am.
Laurie...
There WAS.
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Laurie, you come with us...
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Hi.
Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
You're joking.
Mm-hm.
You're Holly.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
Now I ca-can't remember.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
And it's just in one ear?
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Yes, but you name names.
We--
Like, uh...?
How about you?
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No!  No...
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
I was looking for you.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
And you're in love overnight?
It's so late.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Oh, Mom!
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
Why should I be afraid?
So?
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Elliot lusts after you.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Like what?
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, yes, you have!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
But you don't have any symptoms!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
You're just realizing this now?
Yes, please.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Oh, yeah?
So how are you?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Yeah?
Hi!  Hi!
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Ohh!
Mh-hm.
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I want to experience childbirth.
Hey!
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Okay, okay.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's married...
Sometimes she's terrific...
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
I know, no--  I know.
Hey, hi!
Boy--
What's the matter?
Good.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Thanks for a swell time.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
You look wonderful.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Have you?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Nobody ever said it.
You're kidding me.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Well, what about me?
Oh, wow!
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Hi.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I can't think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
Well.  Word gets around.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
...you...
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Yes?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Who would that be.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
C'mon, pal.
You want to get married...?
You're ready now.
How crazy is that.
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
...nightmare.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
What else did I miss...?
...are they hard to get?
First things first.
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
...sir...?
What reaction?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
He is...?
Look at this:
No. 
Yes sir, I saw it. 
I am all attention.
What is that supposed to mean...?
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
What'd you say, hon...?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
And?  Then?
You know America?
Make them eat the figurine.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
You should get Married.
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Fine, thank you, but
I don't understand.
I want the money.
...<u>sadly</u>...
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Then tell me.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
You want some <u>advice</u>.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
...sir...?
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
No.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Howdy Pouty.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Freeze!  You're busted!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Go stand by the flagpole.
No, they're not from Wendy.
Goodnight, Jasper.
That would be a No.
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
So, are you a cheerleader?
Oh, I have to hear this.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Where did you get these?
I said I was sorry.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Veronica, you look like hell.
What are you doing?
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Mute!
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
What is this shit?
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Perrier water!
Kurt doesn't look too good.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
You know what I want, babe?
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
What now?
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
What does old Stew want?
Who cares!
I'm educating myself!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
You have it.
I'm so happy to see you!
That's coming along well!
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
That.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Poor Father . . .
But that's not true! I've got one.
I'm coming with you.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Of course, yes.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Pitbull attacks.
Sure plenty of times.
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
I thought you loved games.
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Hey buddy!
Do you know where you are?
Dreams?
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Last week...
It's not that kind of date.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
Bill, I got financial problems and...
The homeless!
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
You never saw that picture, huh?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Uh, er... I...
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
I... I know that, John...
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
"A little mistake"!
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
That too.
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Ticket!  What's going on?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
She wants to quit?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
He lost a shoe!
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Safety?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Give it here, Bernard.
Was that your dad?
Where are these toys of yours?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
Do you have a family?
You must value your independence.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
A man?  Was it a dream?
So you don't have anything concrete?
Have you just plain asked him?
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Where'd he go?
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
But it's what we want.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
We're going to think about it.
How was lunch?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
That's not the case.
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
Oh God.
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
God, your sister's really hot.
Let's follow 'em.
Really?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
This ties in with Nash.
He had to come from somewhere.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Detective Bedsoe.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
You sure?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
You?
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Thank you, Thomas.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
This cannot be.
Sometimes.
Do you love me, Conner?
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
If it's good advice.
Where did you get it?
You're hurt.
Yes.
Good evening.
You didn't answer my question.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
On the back it has--
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
How can that be?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Don't leave us, Conner.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
I guess so.
You get anything on Smith?
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Jen?  Are you all right?
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
I have to tell you something --
Not if they're looking at something else.
Then we might as well die rich.
We're cool.
Talley?
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
He needs a doctor.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
What about my father?
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
The cops are comin'!
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
You have his address?
Are you out of your mind?
What do you want?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Want one?
Please get away from me.
Thanks for the shirt.
What happened?
How can we get out?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Louise?
Chief, base.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
The kids are in here!
Where are you right now?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
Okay.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Did you find the disks?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Where's your gun?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
What is this about?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
They fired a rocket at us.
Will you protect us.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
Your police are at the gate?
What do you mean, General?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
We are better here.
You lie.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Satellite feed.
Great, I really need a shower.
Mr. Manager.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
You are the manager?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Who did you call?
You have our cards.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Paul, don't let them die.
Any luck?
How can we help him.
They are being evacuated.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
You could leave, Paul.
Go to the roof now.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I have a confession. When we met...
I will not leave without the twins.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Can I have your name again?
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Rutaganda's place?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
That is why they call it coach?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Twelve are dead.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
What do we do with all these people?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
I don't know.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Jesus H. Christ!
What are you playing here, Price?
Oh, really: who?
This thing's going nowhere.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
What is it? What's in there?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Oh. Jesus.
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
Pritchett!
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
I'll meet you down there.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
-- closed.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Thanks.
Why not?
Good point.
Or an on-line computer.
Price!!
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
Don't touch me!
I'm not laughing, Steven.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
Steven --
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
House 2, Guests 0.
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
I was upstairs!
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Problem where? Looked good to me.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Won't do any good.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Ghosts killed your father?
And you think it's in there?
There is something very not normal going on here!
-- Eddie!!
Sara...?
Damn it.
We don't have proof of that.
Town records are coming up now.
It looks delicious...
Can I do it again tonight?
Can you talk to her?
What about all my other stuff?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Help me!  Please!!!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Good night Angel...
Mommy!
What will Aubrey think?
To our family.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
Are you playing tricks on me?
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Who?
What are you talking about?
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Maura!
We don't know.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Maura.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
What was she afraid of?
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
The rain is letting up.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
Do you mind if I borrow it?
There's something in there.
There's something through that wall!
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
What will he do?  What does he want?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
Why are you so interested?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Sure.  Why?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Welcome. 38
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
But you gave me a rose ...
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
What ... What ... ?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
Joey?
Yes. 53
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Did I miss anything?
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
We're going in from the ground floor.
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
My life is not some deal.  I...
What the hell....
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
I'm going to find out.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Catholic girls are scary...
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Bunny, not you too?
Thanks for sharing.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hoopsucker!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
...Huh?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
I can't print this!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Just got hired today!
How long've you been down here?
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...Geez.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Geez, I --
Yessir.
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
...Who let you in?
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Finally.
Ya don't say.
He don't look wise.
Yellowstone.
...adenoids.
Maybe he's wise.
Good morning, miss.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
But, Mrs. Rand --
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Does she suffer?
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
No, Wes.
It is not beautiful.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
A mental case?
I suppose so.  Yes.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
Wesley!
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
In other words, I'm on trial.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Right o'.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
What's for dessert?
Don't start.
I'm not surprised.
It's a starting place.
You're not going to --
Grades?
About?
Here.
Huh?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Good-night dad.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
Good shit.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
You want coffee or something?
I saw you on your bike today.
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
I suppose. Why?
Oh.
Here you are.
Reverend Edwards.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
How can you do that man?
Shit. You're not planning --
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Just be careful.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Truly? Do speak.
Where you going?
Did you tell Sandy?
I don't ever want to see you.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Why did you -- with Sandy?
When worlds collide.
You get in trouble?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Is this Charles?
Right.
Hey Wendy.
Mikey was looking for you.
It feels warm.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I have to get back.
I could say the same thing about you.
She your only sibling?
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
It's legitimate.
Sorry about...
Thanks.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
That's right.
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
He's just rattling your cage.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Fred Duggar?
Will.
You heard me that time.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
I'm sorry?
I suppose.
That is a picture, nothing more.
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
But why?
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
I couldn't prevent it.
Why always on this night?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Laudanum!
Don't Louis --
Claudia! You did that?
We're immortal. You've always known that.
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
She's no vampire.
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
Diane!!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
Dear God, what have I done?
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Unless I make her one of us...
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
She's here, your wounded one.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Did he die in the fire?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Lestat escaped the fire!
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Oh!
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Nice move.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Be careful, Julie.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Ray...what are you doing?
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
Voodoo.
Julie! Wait! You okay?
You sure?
It was one year ago...
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
This was not my idea.
Deep breaths --
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
I'll come with you.
Well, I'm in school and --
Well, there's some flaws in her...
You guys lost?
What's going on?
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
You're just talking nonsense.
We will see who is the first to die.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Oh, no -— it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
You are fortunate in your father.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I felt he did not like me.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are —— a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Theodosia.
What is her illness?
This girl --
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in —- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
I have had command for the last time —-
Theodosia --
You're crying. Why?
Why in the world can't you?
But they're somebody's children.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
Good morning, sir.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
By letting me help you.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
No.
She's . . .
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Hey, who's that?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Today, over at the house.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
It will?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
What boat you sailing on?
What's that?
Goodbye, everybody!
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
Hmmm . . .
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Oh . . .
George! George!
You're not paid to be a canary.
Is it a charge, sir?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Hello, George, how are you?
George.
No, George, don't . . .
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Some other time, George.
Why didn't you call me?
When?
All of it?
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Made up your mind yet?
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
I'm not very good at this.
Well, why don't you say it?
Eighteen.
Too young or too old?
I'll take it. And then what?
Where'd you get that dress?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
After that, who cares?
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Where're you going?
Mary! Mary!
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Maybe by now they are.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Your dad must be really pissed.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
What is it?
Throw it.
Want to talk about it?
Hey!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Tina!
Chief?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
What else is there to do?
Pop....
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
The what?
The whale's mouth?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Nothing.
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Sean's asleep.
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
I know you did....
What is it?  What's the matter?
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Bullshit.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Mmmmmm.
Anything.  Anything.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Hurry, please.
Be careful....
How much longer?
About damn time.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I thought you were grounded.
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
Heading back?
He's got to help or it won't work.
You're going out.
I want to go with you!
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
It hasn't adjusted.
Go on, Doctor.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
How come?
And what else is bothering you?
It's his work.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Not enough loving.
Where's the rubber band?
What do I do now?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
What's wrong?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
After what happened to us?
Mmmm... you smell good.
Yes.  It's faster.
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
That's right.
Me.
Are you okay?
Go where?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
I told you, something's upset them.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Why?
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
When did this happen?
Hi, Mike.
Sean, do you have herpes?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Let's go, let's go!
What're you doing later?
I don't talk that way.
Ahhh, ahhh...
Yes, there is goes.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Yeah, well I didn't!
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
The world's southern most reaches.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Come on, sweetheart....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
It sure is good to be home....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Close the door.
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
All he did was kiss me....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
They won't kill it....
Stop that....
That....
That hurt....
A big one....
I like Grandma's cooking....
You're coming, aren't you...?
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
How are you doing?
I want you to give up your work....
You could teach...You could....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
You look tired....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Can you just go off...?
I have two right feet.
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I can't....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
Can't this thing go any faster?
What happened?
Let me speak to Ellen....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
They won't fight with me....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
What happened to Clarence and...?
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
How long have you known Hoagie?
What's so funny about that?
We lost it....
You getting a reading on them?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Shit....
Stop that!
I don't like the song.
Holy Christ....
What the hell are you doing?
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
She's in management....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
That bad, huh?
Where's Lenny?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
That isn't what you said before.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Jesus. What are you doin?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
What is that?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
Vehicle references.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
What are you reading?
Are you wearing a uniform?
Are you married?
Pray?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Just your age.
Has he got your aunt's address?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
You do?
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Who sought the warrant?
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Yeah, I guess I do.
What was she like?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
So tonight she confesses?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
He's happy, darlin ..
She married some English prick.
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
You can drive down there, Sir ..
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
I have to finish my job --
Listen to me!
Oh Jerry.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Can I help?
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
That took guts.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Oh my God.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Well, good evening.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Another time, okay Dorothy?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Forgot your keys --
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Oh, thank you.
Denver is where he should be.
Not right now, Jerry.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
You love me now, don't you?
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
You never had The Talk, did you?
Jerry!  You made it --
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
You...
... dick?
You wanted smaller.
Jerry --
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
You said "fuck".
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
ERRR-IIIC!
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Oh, my God.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
That's him. That’s Eric!
It's not safe.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
PAUL!
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
I don’t know.
Absolutely not.
They never got that big.
We need to keep moving.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
I'd better get going.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Do you have any kids?
How do you mean?
It matches the pictures.
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
Resentful.
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
Oh --
But he's the head of InGen!
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Is that kid still bothering you?
Well, is he?
What are you guys gonna do?
Cancel that, Dieter.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
What?
What is that?
Where's the power and radio setup?
It's... behind... us.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
Do you see any family resemblance here?
There' no reason for name calling.
What do they want?!
Come on!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
So that others would know about this place?
Because it exists.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
These formations.  They're dried --
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
That little black line?
Hold it down, Nick!
WHAT ARE YOU-
Where's Kelly?
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
We have to send someone to look for him!
Ask her.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
What?
Phones are out too.
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Did I say jerk?
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
The what?
So what are you thinking?
Are you sure?
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
Ellie, com one!!
Alan?!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
It's all right.
No.
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
Oh, imperfections?
Unpredictability....
Faster, faster!
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
Are they heavy?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
So am I going to help you with your foot?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
Straight-A brainiac!
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
What'd I touch?!
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
It's safe.
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
What's that?
Let's go!
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
Don't do that!
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
We miss you.
I hate trees!
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
Hello?
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Chain saws.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
I think we're lost.
I don't know...
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
What?
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
It's still on.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
A house?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Cute waitresses?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Uh-huh...
See this?
How long will the effect last?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Did you see him?
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
You wanted to see me, sir.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
-- Eduard --
Was there something else?
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Hello again.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Your office is the Workmen's --
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
What's the matter with you?
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
May I ask where your two warders are?
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
It's gone out so quickly?
Ludwig.
Women are all you have on your mind!
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Get the hell out of here.''!
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
He's grubbing for money, father.
Can you fly?
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Jack!
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Man Eater!!!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Are you gonna start it up?
Why?
Uh uh.
Sure dear, yes.
Mm.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
What was better? I made better bait?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
What about?
You said that.
Who?
Honest?
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
Can't you get him?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
You and I -- a relationship.
Bree --
I called Trina.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Mm.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Some mistake perhaps that --
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
I can't follow you.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Well --
John, how are you?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
I know Tom Grunemann.
No.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Are you closing the case?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Where is the child?
What do you have here, Billy?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
What about my orange juice?
When is mommy coming back?
Uh, huh...
Mom, I mean dad...
You get a new fence.
I'm sorry.
All it is is onions and gravy.
Then eat around it.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
I'm sorry...
Is mom ever coming back?
Sleep tight.
See.  That's my name.
Wow!
Is this really your desk?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Objection!
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
So do I.
And how did you find his work?
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
Somewhere in between.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I'm not taking him with me.
Where are you going?
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Only can I still see him?
Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
Yes.
And?
So...what's so terrible about that?
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
And?
What?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
What if I fight it?
What?!  She wants what?!
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You're sure?
Ted.
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Dalai Lama.
And the United Nations? Surely?
Yes.
I will be back in a few days.
How big is Tibet's army?
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Britain chooses not to.
What is the size of our army, now?
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
It is a story, you decide.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
This is Britain.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
You're a beautiful woman.
Keystone what?
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
No way.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
The more he thrashes, the better.
I got something on the screen.
You take care.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
Such the flirt.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Eh.  Fuck it.
And how would we neutralize him?
You're gonna be okay.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Oh my God.
You flew up here because your boss--
He thinks they're what?
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
I'm not mushing it.
Really--
We might as well pack.
If I'm ever in New York...
No.
You think?
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
He's done.  He's dying.
This is a little different.
You're sort of a rude person.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
With what?
They don't believe her.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Hank!
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Kelly.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Hey.
Sorry?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
You and Kevin.
Lecter said a lot of things.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Okay, Miss Starling?
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
Why?
Why not?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
It's much better than your shoes.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
Reasonably so. Yes.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
By the book, he's a sadist.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
Go, Doctor.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
I - ran away...
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Then tell me how.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I heard a strange sound...
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Starling.
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.
What...?
Why didn't you bury those people?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
What?!
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Will you consider that?
I see...
What?!
Who were these people?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
Where do we go from here?
I don't understand!
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
Sir!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Their arms?
The honors of war?
My colors?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
You mind if I take a look at this?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
What's wrong?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
Was there such a thing?
DeJesus!  A readout!
Jesus Christ...
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
You did good...
I need more light on that, Four.
That was a loud one wasn't it?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
Oh, God, she's out there...
Charge set?
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Thank you, Martin.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Made your million, yet?
Personal effects...
You read Russian?
Still bothering you?
What's going on?
You let him get away!
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
What is it?
The shack...
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
How much did you part with?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
Well?
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I hate these Southern shites.
JD.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
They were going to pay, then?
Son, have a look in his locker.
Is he on his own?
Is that you, Dean?
Who was that?
What they like then?
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.

Yeah, one of them's out.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
I hope this is the right move.
You what? What are you on about?
There's nothing in it!
You and me, Tom.
You got it all?
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That's if I want to see you.
Yes?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
What are you doing, Plank?
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
The money, the gear!
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
I don't know what the big deal is.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
How do you think you're going to make a living?
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
That isn't true.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Who's "they"?
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Because it's a job?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
You're dismissed.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
How's business?
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Charley Wade.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
You still going to all the home games?
You look good--
Best part of the job.
Suppose not.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
I got a pretty good guess.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Didn't have a father?
So how come you got into all this?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Tanks, huh?
How's your room shaping up?
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
You going to get married?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
It's a .45.
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
So where does that put us?
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Right.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Eladio Cruz.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Is very beautiful, your car.
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
Bledso
Charley Wade.
I got an idea what happened.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
There was a mandate in the last election--
Steve called for you.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Right. When he was killed.
Nobody's too busy.
Thank you.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
And my father?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
No. Is he sick?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
Can I get this?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Three months.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
People liked him.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Your boy, there--
No--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
I should get back.
Yeah?
Wow.
How come it feels the same?
Yeah?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
They got telephones.
Yeah.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You think we need a new jail?
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
I know you?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
How much?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
That's Butterfield...
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Thanks, Billy.
I don't want him getting in the way.
Don't.
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
How did it go today?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
What did you find?
He taught all this to Swann?
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
What was that?
I've got to help him.
No!  No!  No!
Valentin?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
What about me?
Oh God.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Where the fuck is he?
And this Butterfield guy--
You believe that?
They weren't worth a damn.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Then what do you want?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
Who is she?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
I like to know why things happen.
Leave her alone --
Was that Swann's idea?
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Are they all in the business?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Or murdered, like Nix.
You think I'm an asshole.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Did she know where Nix was buried?
This is where we killed him.
One question.
Why's that?
He's not!  He's not!
You don't think I've got it to give?
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
I don't want to go home.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Oh.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You made it.
What happened to your toe?
Where's your husband?
Do you ever see him?
Do you know where we are?
What do you want to drink?
So, where'd you go today.
When are you leaving?
Why can't it last?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
My stockings.
Lydia?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Like Japanese food.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
I don't know what to do.
Like popcorn?
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I miss you.
Lauren?
I missed you.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Uh...sure...I...what?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
I spaced out.
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
Seemed...on edge.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You killed my parents.
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Yes... and you are?
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
So...what did you think of the tape.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
We need to talk.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
What are you looking for exactly?
You have to say that.
No oxygen to the brain.
Plenty of time.
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
He can see you Thursday.
Good of you to stop by.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
What's the matter with you?
He could see me.
Thanks for handling this.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
She told me she killed them.
Monica, what did you do?
What?
Hi.
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
Engaged.
Yeah, you met her?
Whatever.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Which one for tomorrow?
What?
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
What?
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Damn, girl.
So how long is this trip?
Nah.
You might be the only one with a job.
A horse?
Like you don't give her a hard time.
I found you someone.
They ever love you back?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
You shoot like a girl.
But?
One, up.
For real?
I never knew a girl that could play.
I think we gotta kiss now.
I want to ride my own bike.
I don't have to do what you say.
A ride home.
See you made it.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
When'd you get this?
What?
I can't be nice to a fan?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
It's okay, little baby.
Forget Tonya Randall.
Then prove her wrong.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
Hey.
Who was that?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
What?
So that's it, just forget about us?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
What are the doctors saying?
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Funny.  I never did.
You visiting?
So...how's the knee?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
I heard enough.
And what happens when you lose?
Zeke.
We should head over.
With who?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Still the man.
Just...leave it alone.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
What people?
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Still is, so let yourself out.
I ain't a damn liar.
After five years.
Look, I'm busy.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
What surery?
Hello?
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
What kind of Cancer?
My mother had breast cancer.
Don't sit down.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
For what?
Wilson.
Yeah.
No.
About two years ago.
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
Ok, ok. I'm back.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
You really use strong language.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
Just say no.
-- you the resident here?
-- what kind?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Have you ever been there?
What happend, what's going on?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
It's ok --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
I paid you back.
Braces?
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
Get a girlfriend.
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
Do me a personal favor --
No.
All it takes is one second?
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
I would just want to clear some things up:
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
And what did your parents do?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
And your father?
Are you asking me a question?
How long have you taken care of him?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
I AM CALM.
Marcie.
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
You on any medication?
--- What was that?
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
Yeah. Yes.
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
-- did she talk to you?
Did you tell her?
How do we do this, then?
No.  No.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
Was there anyone that I know?
Who?
Just once.
Two years...three years...
I don't.
I don't know....
I think that you know.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Yes you do.
Hello?
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
Are you on drugs right now?
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Shut the fuck up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
Hello.
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
What would you like?
The fuck is wrong with you?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
Be ready at two --
You coulda been in front --
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Mother -- ?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Louis, please -- !
Your Majesty...
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
What is that?
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
More wine!!
Hang himself?!
Where are you going?!
But --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
He seeks redemption.
No!  Stop --
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Where are we?
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
We go someplace dangerous.
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Phillippe...?
One for all.  All for one.
Betrothed?  I think not.
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
What number, on the first page?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
The food doesn't please you?
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Shall I leave?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
We're by Ozone...
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
What did the six-toes have to say?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Are you alright?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
What?  Wait a minute -
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Where up north?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
Tubbs, it's me.
And?...
Donut?
Where are you going?
Are you a regular there?
Ditched you?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Long gone, huh?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
Why not?
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Run it.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
Something Lecktor said.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
Parking permits...
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
When do you need it?
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Reba...
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
'No' what?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
I want to see Lecktor now.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's misunderstood.
I don't want to do that,
'Intimate? !"
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
To yourself...
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
What the hell can I do?
If I were?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Do you remember what you said?
Can you quit?
And... where are things?
Is Crawford going with you?
Mama was probably asleep.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Maybe we should give it some time...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Thanks for the lift.
Meet point's up ahead!
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I figured I'd ask you...
How did it happen?
She got all right?
And Hobbs died?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
And?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Do you dream much, Will?
What were the yards like?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
I don't believe in God.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
People love... comedians.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Andy?
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Andy!
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
I'm sorry, George...
How long would they let me sleep?
They're having a laugh...
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
Tony Clifton.
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Right...
Cue the commercial!
Excuse me -- ?
Andy, the theater's that way!
And all this will be for real?
You're NOT DYING!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
Hey Andy, good show.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
Sir, do you have a problem?
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Then the informant is real.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
He had an accident.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
Is that...?
Five.  Since I've been here.
Thanks... for the drink.
What is he doing?
The cubicle across from you is empty.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
Why not?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
What are you doing?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
Do you understand, Neo?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
The beginning?
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Got it.
We need an exit.
That vase.
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
That was a long time ago.
Uh-oh...
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
But an Oracle can.
Is it?
Should I be?
Are you all right?
What is it?
What?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
Zion?
It's a city?
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Which way?  Which way?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
They've burned through the outer shields.
Yeah.
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Look at her.
Nervous?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Don't promise...just deliver.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Shut up!
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
I think we should see your uncle.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
OK, ok...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
Charlie, this is business.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Hey, where you been?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
No, she's got epilepsy.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
"Francis Macomber."
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Please take it.
No.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
What's the matter with this kid?
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Must have been all the liquor in him.
That's your name?
-- But he does seem very nice.
Dinner?  Again?
Daddy!
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
What, honey?
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
What are you eating.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
It doesn't matter.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
I'm all excited --
No --
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Why?
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Not time yet.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Jennifer.
How long you here, Joe?
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Oh yes, I do.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Yes --?
Yes?
And I'll be a visitor.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
Yes...
Almost.
He's taking a nap.
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
We know so little about each other --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
Bill --
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
Joe --?
There's one to every rule.
What's it like where I'm going?
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
Why did you go to the hospital?
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Are you threatening me?
You are --?
Yes.
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
'Yes' what?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?!
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
We're all here, Bill --
Drew told me.
I don't like to interfere.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
You're terrible.
What is it, Daddy --?
It'll come back, Daddy.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Then what is it?
You don't know anything about Joe --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
What was that?
Why?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
I've got patients coming in --
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
You said you liked me.
38.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
30.
Slam it?
That's it?
Should I wear it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
So you're holding my calls?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
It's isolated.
So I just take your word?
Such as?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Who?
Did you?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
My name's Leonard.							 *
You've read it a hundred times.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Like what?
Envelopes?							    *
How do you know this?
How do you know him?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
No, you won't.
You won't remember!
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
Your name's Teddy.
No.  I was in Namibia...
Yeah.
We know these people...!
And...?
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Yeah?
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
My end?
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Is it December?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Yero, by himself?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
What...?
You afraid of violence?
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
What friend?
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
What do we got?
How much we looking for?
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
What are you talking about?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Oh, good...
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
That sonofabitch!
What do you care?
You sure you heard what I said?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!
For money.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
You got a comb?
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
What d'you want?
What you got me up here for?
Here. Don't even thank me.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Sold. Let's go.
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Tunnel?
Anybody bitten?
Yeah. How's Mom?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
You know where they are?
How far?
Yes...?
Just what?
...are you with the Consulate?
Got a family back there?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
And you?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Hello, Billy.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
What?
Whose?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Just got some news on Bell.
I think I've been poisoned.
Never was anybody like you...
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
The Department of Public Health...
What?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
It's me. Can you hear me?
It worked before...
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
Oh, come on, come on!
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
What's your new book called?
Pretty rough so far.
The profanity bothers you?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Done?
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
You've been out of your room.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
What things?
Yes, Paul.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Just leave it, all right?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Newspapers?
Marcia, please.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
Not much luggage.
How grateful?
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
Sort it all out.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
What are you talking about?
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
What you got there, mate?
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
There she is.  I got visual.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How're we doin', then?
Uh-huh.
- this is very disconerting..
So where did I got right?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
-- his left jacket pocket.
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Like what?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
What did you think of him?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Very.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Let's start from the inside out.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
You have Bellerophon.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
Come on!
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
That's S.O.P..
What kind of show.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Donít Jim.
Is he serious?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
There was nobody on the bridge.
I didn't say that.
Claire...Hey...
Claire.
Go ahead.
Yes.
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
It's quite out of the question.
Mm - Hmmm...
What was your deal with Job?
IMF mainframe.
Give me the God damn gum.
Jack.  Jack.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
The package is in the open.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
Would you remove your hat please?
I thought I was going to see Max.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Tell you what?
What problem?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
I usually am.
You got it.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Jim, itís over.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Why don't you take a look?
That's what we do isn't it?
Such a nice ass.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Are you ready?
Rose, pass the wine.
You look tired.
In a month.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
I got it done.
You're married.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
That's it.
Loretta. What's that smell?
Fast.
No.
A bride without a head!
What? What have we done?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
But that's cause he don't know!
What are you talking about?
That was just so... awful!
No thanks.
What's the matter?
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
This is your place.
This is where we're going!
You've gotta get outta here.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
I have no secrets from my family.
What?
Will you live here?
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
How's the mother?
What the hell happened to you?
Your hair's different.
Do you love him, Loretta?
Hi.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
I know.
Who was that?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
Can I get another one of these?
Sorry. That was rude.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Yes.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
Yes.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Rita. Rita.
I don't know.
You got me.
Halt!  Who goes there?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Who are the Britons?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
A what?
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
I move for no man.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Well, what's that then?
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Look!
I'll do you for that.
Nu!
What with?
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Look, you're a busy man ...
Where?
... but a two-thirds majority ...
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
I feel fine.
What is your name?
Why?
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
But I don't like her.
Well, look er, I ...
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
Hurry!
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
I done it again.
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
I speak as I find, Archie.
How much?
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
What?
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
What are you doing?!
You've got three broken ribs, man!
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
Checked and locked, sir.
Checked and locked, sir.
Good man.  And is she all right?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
It's the Queen's decision.
Convey her a message.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Mama...
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
By whose authority?
Checked and locked, sir.
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Surely --
Then I envy yo.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
She'll think I betrayed her.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Those, over there, there.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Ma'am?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
I came as quickly as I could.
Is that not enough?
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
What did he want?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Where did you find it by the way?
Unwell?
How long has he been this sick?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
There is one other matter.
Why is he not here?
What's the riddle?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Dead?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Talk to me.
What's her problem?
Nick...
I have to talk to you.
What do you mean by "weird"?
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
So how did it know my name, then?
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
Well?
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
You mean we learn the rules...
Jesus Christ!
Alex...
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
Okay.  It's West.
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
Then we'll go home?
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
So how do I start?
So what do you think?
Someone's shut off my money!
But I'm not broke.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Will you meet with him?
I understand.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
It's unbelievable!
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
There was an accident. I came here.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
I think I've been hurt.
No.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
Mulholland Drive.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Okay.
No. Just the coffee.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"You're still here?"
"Really?"
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
"Before I kill you."
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Yeah, what for?
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
You see what I mean...
You feel it?
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Hardly.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
What are you doing ?
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
What's the trick here ?
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
I... I .....
This is cute.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
It's fine thanks.
That's not to tough.
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
You okay ?
Don't eat at the console.
But, he's...
Trust is earned not given away.
What's wrong ?
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Zach, how old are you, son ?
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
One moment dear... 
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
What's next ?
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Was that the Old Man ?
What the ... ?
Are you okay ?
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
What now ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
We have a baby?
Can I see him?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Never heard of him. 
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
That's okay.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
What can I do for you?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
He's writing. Hello?
Vada?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Thanks
Don't wake up Vada.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
He said it was a gift.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Does it work?
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
It's dangerous!!
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
What's he smoking?
It's not his fault!
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
An adventure?
No?
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
But...are you engaged or something?
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He was caressing.
Hi!
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Something wrong?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
The boss is watching us...
You are perfectly healthy.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Stiffs??
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I had a good time tonight.
I haven't danced in.....
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Can we see it from the back yard?
Did you ahh, love him?
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Why not?
Did I kill my mother?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
I found this.
In the garage.
What was my mama like?
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Why?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Sure.
This is one big house for one single person.
How much does it cost?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
I paid the money.
Please.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Cause she's dying.
Do you like her?
My Dad was funny?
Hi.
Did you read ALL these books?
What are they about?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Hey look at this, no feet!
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Hey look at this!
You have no personality.
Is that your Dad?
Heaven.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Jump in the water!!
Get up!?
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Say something it's too quiet.
You don't miss much.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Blood oath.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Elmer's Glue?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
But I can't be dry.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
For the twins? What in the world is th...
So... one almost has to...
He'll see right through it.
I never want to go through this again.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
And she's all wrong for me!
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Every day.  She makes the bed.
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Don't you throw up on boat?
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Michael...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Lower.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
I said, I've been real tired.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You bet.
She's fine.
His Word.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
How is she?
He has that sign with the tree.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
What's he running for?
Hey!
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
You bet.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Mr. Green?
Yes, sir.
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
You must really like him.
Wrecks.
What year?
Nashville.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
I don't think so.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Bye.
Well, can you tell me why?
How long have you been with them?
Doesn't it have a name?
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Stay.
When did you think it would happen?
I knew when I first met you.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Premeditated murder.
Hello.
It's me. What is it?
I can do benefits
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
What National TV...?
An album.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
You know Bill is really mad at you.
We just got a gold record.
Probably a little too long.
I'm Opal.
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
Pleasure
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
You want a ride into town?
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Which do you recommend?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
You got something you want to do?
Mickey!
Who isn't?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
How come you never talk?
Say something.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
Not to anybody. She sings.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
And they made the first move?
Hypnotizing.
Only on a much grander scale.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Take a wild stab!
You can't be serious?
Who?
Are you all set?
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Rollin'...and speed!
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
But how can you say that?
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Ya know, I was.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Could we go with you and film it?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
You a union man?
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
Want to keep your job, boy?
I said: Cut it out!
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
People seen him 'round.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Don't say much, do you?
And his age?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
That's two bucks, Joe.
My father's the preacher.
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
How about another beer?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
Not here, Duff.
No, on the porch.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
What about him?
What's wrong?
Everything you cook is good.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Don't deny me, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
What's so hot 'round town?
Just get her drunk.
A whole lot, Frankie.
They all got families to support.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
Wouldn't have known you.
What happened?
I asked you somethin', boy!
Take it easy, Pop.
What did you say, boy?!
How often is that?
Come on, Pop.
They'll run you out.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
No. Why?
Shut up, Will.
Your Raoul?
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
We got any shots?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
What are you doing in here?
Can you get us into Straylight?
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Alright. Let's talk business.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
What are you talking about?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
You've got your orders.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Hey, bro.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
She's ready to go.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
Where did you here that?
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
What is it?
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
How soon is soon enough?
On a good run... yeah.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
...Feels like you.
Case... it's four a.m.
I'll get the car.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Who?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
What is with this school and prom?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
It is?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
YOU DID.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Who told!
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
How about this?
Cuuuute!
Hi!
What is this?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
How many times have I fired her?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Uhh, no.
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Maybe we should go in a different room?
You having fun?
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
Wow. This must be big.
What!?
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Are you--scared?
Boys.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
No, I'm alone.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Yes.
I don't know.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Aloha! Welcome!
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
We followed your instructions.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
Where're we taking him?
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
Yes.
If you went away, what would become of me?
Coming...
Why not?
Where are you going?
Come back here!
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
You two got a thing going, or what?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
You're fucked in the head.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
You know her?
I think it's sad...
Are you okay.
Are you sure?
What is this place?
About not finding any bogey men?
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
What's so funny?
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
What's that?
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
I know who's trying to kill you.
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Max, where's Kristen?
You need me, I'll be here all night.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Crossed over?
But nightmares are the common thread?
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Ms. Thompson.
You're late.
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
To who?
Take us there, Kristen.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Who would know where they were hidden?
Nancy...
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
Science...I suppose.
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
Freddy.
How is he?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
Hi.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Sorry about that...
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Coffee?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Here we go.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Hi.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
So who left who?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Well...
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
That's not true.
But... wait... there are things to say.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Can I have your autograph?
What does it say?
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bella -- this is Anna.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Hello, Bernie.
What do you think?  Good move?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
I suppose so.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Hey.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
What did she say?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Yes.
Spike!
What's going on?
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Why?
Yes, Mister Harding?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Yes, ma'am...
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
On this ward?
Oh, I had them removed.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
That's it! We made it!
So do I!
Good. Why don't you join us?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
That's okay, kid...
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
I'll bet a dollar.
Neither do I...
What are you doing?
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Lobotomy!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
So why are you talking to him?
It doesn't help him.
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
Don't you have any clubs?
'Kay, place your bets.
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
I wanna see it...
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
When?
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
Time out!
Yeah, buddy?
How do ya know that?
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Ten bucks.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
What are they?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Hi.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Yeah!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Whew! Hiya, boys!
What happened?
What?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
She was your sister.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
Excuse me?
Were they pen pals?
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
What?...
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
There is one other thing you should know about me.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Where are you going?
You're limping.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Mickey Spillane.
Do you want me to do it?
What?...
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Yes.  I am.
Is something the matter?
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Hello.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
What looks good?
So, what are we waiting for?
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
I have vacation time coming to me.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
You okay?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Your brother?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
What's that supposed to mean?...
That was a long time ago.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
And then what, Faith?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Hi-iii...
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
It was a ouija board, remember?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Peter found him?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
It's siesta.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
She what?!
And you didn't tell her?
Where is she?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Right now?
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Working hard?
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
See! You don't understand!
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
I think we're O.K.
They play pretty rough.
I'm with Terry.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I can get home all right from here—
What?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
What for?
The Golden Warriors.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Terry!
His— racket?
You haven't finished your beer.
What are you crying for?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
Pigeons... .
You... .
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Terry, no, no... .
Terry, for God's sake.
Edie.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
—It started as a favor— for my brother— you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no— a favor— Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but— Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it— stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away— and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
About Edie?
This is my business.
What did you say?
You all right, Nolan?
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Count this.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You got some nerve.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
Maybe I will— one of these days.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What do you mean?
Those creatures..!
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
But they are not yet one of us.
What kind of symbol?
Well?
When!?
The moon is almost gone!
There are others.
You may take her now.
You better hope there is.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Oh, is this Adele?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Adele?  You in there?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
I don't know where he is.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
You at least bring the gun?
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
Let's go to Detroit.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
How long were you with the girl?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
You ever wear one of these?
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
Hello, Daniel.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
You talked to him?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
All right, but...
You get the key?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
You comfy?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Why not?
A girl.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
So she did help you?
You coming back?
You getting serious on me now?
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
You think he's lying?
Wait in the car.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Thanks for your help.
Really?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
The fish?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The flight?
You busted out?
There were others.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Gee, I wonder why not.
It's a guy you know.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
That was some shit, huh?
Flyweight.
What's wrong with you?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
No.
Dad...
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
You here all by yourself?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
Thank you...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Midge.
We have a problem here?
...the fuck is this...
Are you sure they're here?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
What lizard?
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
How could you do this?
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
Yeah.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
Don't get smart with me, son.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
Well sure, Colonel --
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Sorry to trouble you.
What's your name?
How often you fight like this?
Thank you, 'Mam.
You take care, Dorie.
Oh, this is Betty.
Danny's not coming?
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Rafe --
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Leapin' Jesus!
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
Let's go.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Carol!
Welcome to the singles scene.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
The only one?
Where is it?
I don't get it.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Charlie really has a great voice.
Peggy Sue!
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
You drive like a maniac!
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Looking good out there.
Yeah. Like that.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I'm sorry Charlie.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
What're you doing here?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Just take a look at it. 
Come back to me.
I thought you were...for a while.
Hello, Charlie.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
It was Beth's idea.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
You think so?
I thought I knew everything about him.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Oh, you're both so naive.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light—headed.
Mom!
I'm excused.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Where have you been?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Dancing with you.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
What a great kite.
Sort of.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
What's wrong?!
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
What?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
What's wrong with your face?
What was the file name?
Why, Beckett?
This time. What about next time?
Aren't you giving an exam?
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
Why are you getting dressed?
Drew!
Jerk... What did you say?
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
We're not skipping this treatment.
Fuck you.
I'm not going to die.
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Innocuous?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
Congratulations.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
PARRTYY!
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
Get it?
What do you want?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Thanks for coming by.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
Where's Dad?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Were you pleased with his work?
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Joe?
Right.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Let's continue.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
You came for us....
Oh, Lord....
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
But I just wanted to say --
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
What do you see? Riddick?
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
What, you're afraid?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Just give me your hand.
You'd die for them?
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
There....
We just keep him locked up forever?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
Smoke screen for what?
This does not help us, Johns.
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Fry?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Imam. Slow down.
Where's Mr. Johns?
What're you doin'?
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
...then we saw this.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
How did you know we'd come here?
I apologize.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
The best. But we won't need them.
Where does the river lead?
Taylor, I'd rather you -
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Now, just a minute --
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Which direction?
Hmph.
Objection!
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Landon! Send a last signal.
All right --
She comes along too.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Lucius.
Gorilla hunters ...
Who put them up?
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
ThatÕs a lie!
What about me?
No.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Twelve hundred years ago.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
You! ... You knew about this?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
So what's the problem?
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Yeah?
You lame Taylor?
Where's he from?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Fuck this shit!
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Come on man!
First time?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Merle?
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
Right...
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
The brush-off, huh?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
And do you amuse the guests?
You're drinking it.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
Bad?
Dance? Tonight?
Why not?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Anything I can do about it?
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
They're going to arrest me.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
No.  I paid him off.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Where's you get it?
FLorida?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
But even if you were in love with me.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
And without much discrimination.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
So you're not a cop.
The usual grind.
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
Recently, then.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
What do I get for it?
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
Where's the shell?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
You can find out.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I am a fool.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Now, you're being beastly.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
I have a rough idea.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Terrific.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Are you going to have coffee?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Can I give you a lift?
I thought it was tremendous.
Oh yes?
Did she talk about me?
I haven't seen much of you.
Not yet you know any of these people?
And the Argies.
Now, top secret file.
You approve!
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
Perhaps I will, then.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Thanks.
Hello, Jimmy.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
It was last year.
Friends of yours, huh?
What's their program?
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Thanks for stepping in.
Don't you gamble?
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
Utah, you copy bruddah?
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Where's Roach?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
What?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
They don't go for the vault?
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
What do you want?
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
This gonna take long?
What's goin' on?
Those are cold.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Why us?
What story did you give to Davis?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Thanks.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
What in God's name...?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
I like your hat.
Congratulations, sir.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
No, you look like a hooker.
That's ridiculous.
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
So do day jobs.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
No, but it's getting there.
Get in.  This side.
Better believe it.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
It's a very good year.
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Where'd you go?
By breaking up a company's assets --
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
This isn't a date.
Hello?
What if someone tries to steal it?
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I know.  I'm glad.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Right.
I got tired of hating my father.
Aw, don't... no...
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
What's up, where you going?
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Love this car!  Is it new?
What time's diner tonight?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
You broke my nose.
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
He... he just does.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Kit...
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Niece?
I got a dress.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
They will serve salad.
Hi, Barney!
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
He will come for me.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I only dog paddle.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
The Man in Black?
Will this do?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Oh no. No, please.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Yellin.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
Your guess is as good as mine --
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
-- anything you want --
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Sir. Sir.
Slow going?
We'll wait until you're ready.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
You are wonderful!
I must know.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Go in, get after her!
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
I want to duel him left-handed.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
You guessed wrong.
You feeling any better?
Your grandfather's here.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Oooooooops!
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Here, don't panic.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
What did I do?
What scheme?
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Maybe it's not true!
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Don't help me.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
Not.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Always.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Do it!  Do it!
Get car.  Get car.
We make love?
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Like clockwork.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
You out to buy a motel?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
What do you mean?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
I don't know.
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Forty thousand dollars.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Where?
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
He didn't come back here?
Our Deputy sleeps.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
You going to wait here for me?
Sorry.
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
For what?
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
Is your time so empty?
You should... mind it.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Alright, Miss... 
You slept here all night?
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Oh?
Norman took a wife?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
How do you do.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
What were you dreaming about?
Did you hear?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
You lie!
Yes, why?
I think so.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
I am right! I know I'm right!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
You weren't going with her?
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
What is it? What happened?
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
What was her name?
We flopped the first time out.
Of what?
Dysfunctional --
I've been dreaming about this.
Yes?
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
In what sense were they bad?
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Actually, I am, though.
'Course it does.
Don't mention it.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
Yeah.
There goes Mother.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
Why is it taking so long?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
I am not being brutal to her!
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
She hasn't actually done anything...
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
How is she?
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Strange voices, Rose?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Your baby?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Well, you run on now.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Never again, never again...
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
Indivisible and inseparable.
You think it's that good?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
Kittle...
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
What's the plan?
When you planning to cut back on that?
Dean Martin.
They... they shot me.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
It doesn't say that.
That's him alright.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
General Jim Beam, then.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
You could start over again with cash like that.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
Our resignations.
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Pure horse.
Arriving tonight
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
You know what I mean.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
I'm gonna get beside him.
Can't be worse than you.
You need a doctor.
Come again... ?
Think Zimmermann's watching?
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Your eyesight will return in time.
As you wish.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
I have felt him, my Master.
The same as always.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Shall we try and go around?
Han! Chewie?
Good luck.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Here we go again.
There it is!
What do you remember?
Tell me.
Yes. It's you Leia.
If that is your destiny.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Well, I'm sorry.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
I was telling the truth.
Janet.
Yes.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Well I want to leave.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
You're OK by me.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never

Oh, no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
...How's the turtle food this week?
It's Thanksgiving.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
Is everything all right?
...I can't beat him.
...I dunno.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Owe you what?
He got lucky.
No doctor!
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
How was the flight, Champ?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Kiss my ass.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
...That's an old one.
This a con?
Few minutes?
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
Ya sure?
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
I'm sure you are.
Did you hear what I said?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
What was I gonna say?
...What?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
How old are ya?
How old?
More like thirty.
The legs must be goin'.
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Think about it.
Did ya get the message, kid?
'Bout an hour ago.
Whatta' those?
Fifty years, huh.
Please, kid.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Wanna keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
What's ya sister like to do?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
What gaps?
Do you feel you have a chance?
I'll tear his head off.
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
So you decided to help him after all?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
So where is it?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
When will I hear from you?
You got the will in there, don't ya?
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Romeo! Romeo!
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Farewell, my cuz.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
'Tis he.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
That dreamers often lie.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Nurse.
This is important.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Lose them!
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
That fucking figures...
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
We'll die if we stay here!
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Then where is it?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Then I guess we're set.
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
Yeah.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
So this is what, a test?
So what is it you want to know?
Created?
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Where to?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I borrowed that, too...
I've seen a lot of people die before.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Alright, it's done.
Clearly.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
I never made that claim.
You would have done that?
They don't have the package.
Not here.  They might see it.
Would you stop with that...
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
That's a good question.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
What are we going to do?
We don't know that.
It won't work.
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I've got one condition.
Shhh!
It's the right thing to do.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
I can't do that.
That's not what I mean.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Not bad enough to kill him.
Here it is.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
How are ya?
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Yeah.
OK.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Sally, do you love me?
I don't know.
I guess we can get started.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
She's not his type.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
It was going to be a surprise!
What are you saying?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
I'll settle for a third of that.
We're out of here.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
Don't hurt me.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
Is that the mail?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
This whole place?
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
You think he skipped town?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Winner six!
Invitation, please.
The band has been playing over an hour.
I got my sources.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Yeah, that's right.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
You bring American money?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
I'm sorry.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Not Yu.  You!
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
It sounds impossible --
Follow the Rich White Man?
You sound like that all the time.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
No.  It was my singing.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
No.  It's not right.
I don't want to hear this.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
Well we're not friends.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Hello, Benjamin.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Let's go.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Lee!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
No you didn't!
We made it, man.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
I could use a little vacation.
Put your arms around me.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
He was just doing his job.
You talk very fast.
It's the same thing!
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Right....
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
Want some?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
What a surprise!
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Jesus...what do you want?
How much they want?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
You sonuvabitch.
Hello.
I will not have friends in America.
What is he up to now?
Ahh.
Really?
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
I'll get the dress.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
"Nothing but net."
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Rub your ears.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Yeah.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Your two cinnamon rolls.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Getting nervous?
Maybe someday.
What!?
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
Yes, you!
I'm listening.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Ya think?
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I'm going to kill myself.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
I'm really rooting for this one.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
I hate boats.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
Am I what they had in mind?
Is that all right with you?
Who is it?
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
Walter.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I told you.  Nothing --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Men never get this movie.
Hello.
Did you talk to him?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
I love the symphony.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
It's probably just the flowers --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Hello.
All righ...
Why not?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
Is he home right now?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
It is not --
Dad, could you close the door?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Do you want a fruit plate?
What?!
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
How did they get our phone number?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Jed's got cables.
It was sinking.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
God, she's beautiful.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Did too.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
It's a little derivative.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
It takes time --
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Got any more ideas?
Who? A scab?
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Was it expensive, the beer?
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
How do you feel?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
Where are you going?
You mean you're ready to give up?
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Go on. Spill it.
No ...
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
What?
What?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't.
Fuck you.
Why don't you call the cops?
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Oh. Hi.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Is that how you play?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
How much time do you have?
I'm kind of busy.
He knows where I work.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You want a hit?
Was he the president?
Okay
Why?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Come on, guys ...
Now get talkin'
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
You got a name?
You think I'm a Judas?
What the hell are you doing here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Turns out he's connected.
He knows somebody ratted him.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
He's the only one I told.
What's on the other end of this thing?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
My sentiments exactly.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
Yep.
Jackson?
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Y'all come back.
He ain't Wade.
No kiddin'?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
Upham?
It looks like a Renoir.
It seemed appropriate.
What is it?
I wonder where they're going.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
What'd you say, Captain?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Beasley's dead.
You get a translator, Captain?
Uh, Captain...
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Oh, yeah?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
Uh, oh.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
I'm listening, sir.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Up.  We're moving out.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
No, sir.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Yes, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
How fast?
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
I'll take the whole set.
Then what's love?
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Lloyd is doomed.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Why?
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
I'm sorry.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
You think you know what this money is?
That's right, work it out.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Mom, please?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Thank-you.  The real world.
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Are you busy on Friday?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Keymaster?
He does this every year?
Have a good sleep.
It's just you and your dad, right?
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
You have to meet Bess.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Okay, this is important...
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I think that we should spend some time apart.
It sounded like you did.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Is this because of your dad?
Did you tell anybody?
What do you want?
One more time would be nice.
How's it going?
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
You're freaking out here man.
Yeah.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
No, really.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
I know
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
My car.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Oh boy.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Ooop, excuse me.
I was gonna...
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Later for you, Luke.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
It's not a charade, all this?
Luck.
We started without you.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
What's that?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
What others?
That'd be fine.
I was just the accountant.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
They arrived.
I didn't do enough.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
We know that, son.
Can't we hold him?
I would say we are now officially baffled.
I heard a noise.
Outside.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
Hello? Ted?
WHAAAATT?
I don't think that's a good idea.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Where is Sidney's father?
And are the police sure about that?
What are you going to do?
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
I could use some therapy.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
About what?
This is exactly what I don't want.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
Why?
Where's Sid?
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
So we found a compromise.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Yeah?
You broke my heart.
They're roomates.
This is all too familiar.
Let's go.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
What do you want?
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
He tried to kill her first.
I got a surprise for you.
Knock yourself out.
Who is that guy?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
How many guys they have on you?
And white.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Take it off.
You ass.
Do you work for her now?
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What?!
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Who?
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Jesus Gale what happened?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Yeah?
Where are you Dewey?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Geez.
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
But you know my favorite name?
It is in my script.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
No.
Where?
I didn't kill anybody.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Duh... that's quick.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Nope.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
I thought she was dead.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
You rode your bike out there?
Oh Billy... Please... God...
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
NO! Don't believe him.
I don't understand...
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Hello?
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
What do you want?
Listen, asshole...
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
How do you know his name?
Where are you?
Please don't hurt him.
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
No...
Now for the real question.
You tricked me...
What door am I at?
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
And why is that? Has something happened?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Drive by patrol.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Off the record. No cameras.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
You're evil.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't come any closer.
You coming tonight?
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
What's Leatherface doing here?
Why are they doing this?
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Take a message.
Come on, Sid.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
TATUM!
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
That's mature.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Have you heard?
Already.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
What the hell's going on?
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
What time is it?
Give me the gun.
You didn't know.
Where we headed?
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Just keep leading the way.
Here he comes.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
Drop it.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Is that clear?
Same color and texture.
This doesn't make any sense.
It's too soon for him.
It's my wife.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Did you read them?
No witnesses of any kind?
Nothing.
What?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
And?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
So they ran our list.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
What are you talking about?
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
Well... what the fuck, man?
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
It smells good.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
How long have you lived here?
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
You ain't goin'...
What good does that do?
I didn't give any order to fire!
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
I say NO!
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
Well, the reward still stands...
Told ya, didn't I?
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Say it. We're beat!
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Good night...Laurie...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
That don't make 'em kin...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Think she means for us to follow?
Ethan, quit it!
No...She's not...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
She's not a little girl any more.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Where?
But couldn't you...?
I mean the armchair!
Where are you going?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Cherry-red Tears.
I miss Tommi so much.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Who's that?
She was old.
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
Ellen.
No, I've never seen him before.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Oh…what have I done?
What is the chief part?
How much?
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
So now you are free to love
This time we take your boots off!
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Do you know it?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Cut round him for now.
Not ready? Where is she?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Your mother, and your father
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
Will!
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
Master Shakespeare
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Even your play.
And that was only my first try.
There is time. It is still dark.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
Will you read it for me?
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
Wait there.
Yes, sir.
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
And her voice? Like lark song?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
Only on expenses.
Don't you worry about that.
How much did you pay?
Doesn't it worry you?
I want to secure it.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
I've never seen any of these men before.
Parked outside?
Right.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Well, she had problems --
So we'll meet him, then?
-- instead of what he is --
Have you seen Hugo?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
So?
Alex.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
What's he doing here?
No.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
It's OK. There's no problem.
Can you afford this place?
It's about the burglary.
Downstairs.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Just get on with it, Alex.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Do you know many of these people?
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Expecting anyone?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
In this firm.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
You get the job done.
What guy that died?
Would you like to come in?
What's it about?
The human condition.
I write about it?
Anyway, you remember Harold?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
Lester.
-- is that right?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
I'll be back in a while.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
-- Anyway.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, I know.
Hi.
But aren't you...
That headboard.
You going to answer it?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
I asked you first.
Well, are you?
Yeah, it is.
Yeah.
That you're just like your mother.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
Yes, Buffums.
I'm sure.
Where do you want to do this?
Well, what do you think?
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
No.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
-- yeah.
-- sure.
Where are you going?
God, there's Lester...
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
-- White ladies?
-- yes, George.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
George.
I already said hello.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
What do you want?
A friend dropped me off.
Now, Jackie --
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Obviously.
What do you wanna know for?
How?
I wish you'd go now.
Yes, yes, I did.
No.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Sorry, honey, I...
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Well anyway...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Godammit, George...
I wanna hear about it, George.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Did they have something against me?
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Want a drink?
Have a drink.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
What about Jackie?
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
Yes.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
Of course not.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Here.
Fine.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
I would say so, yes.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Johnny!
I'm terribly sorry.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
George? Was he alone?
-- why?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Thank you.
Do you have something against traveling?
No of course not.
Everything okay, son?
I'm hungry.
Are you having a good time?
Yes.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Are you sure?
Yes.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
I won't make any noise.
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Danny?
Mommy!
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
No.
Because he hides.
But eh what was the matter with him?
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
No.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
It's good to see you.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Perfect for a child.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay... stay away!
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Only in a very general way.
Well, obviously some people can be
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
Right there.
What time does the plane leave?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Yes. Go away.
Please, Uncle Al.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Are you all right, Marty?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
There's something else scary.
You all right, Marty?
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Was it a prescription?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
It could have been anything, Marty.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
But how?
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
No... it's fine.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
HE'S SO FINE.
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Hopeless I
She's a pro.
A cigarette?
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Oh my Lord!
I don't want to mess anyone up...
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Are you leaving us?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
St. Anne's?
The reason?
I see.
It has come to pass.
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
The vow of obedience.
Is this all the food I get?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
It never solves anything.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
A vote?
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
What're you doing?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
We're looking for Mike.
Well?
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
A sweater.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
I don't understand.  Where is she?
Reverend Mother?
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
We must be a curious sight to him.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Stains of blood.
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Damn... damn... damn...
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
The Widow Windsor.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
What is it?
Out there.  What do you see?
Thank you.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
What was she doing?
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
People have put their trust in you.
What are you on about?
And this gives worth to butchery?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
It is only me.
My God... what has happened?
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
What is so urgent?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
What was that?
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Where?
I know you saw me.
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
You know what, by God?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Leave.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Stop it, Doyle!
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
I want to be baptized.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
What are all them books?
How come?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Who did you kill?
Were they bad people?
Well, I hate him.
You want to go with me?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
Why?
So it died when it come out?
It was alive?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
It was fun, anyhow.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
You all right, Mama?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
You walk fast, don't you?
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
A blister shore can hurt.
Karl, you up?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
What brings you back?
Do you have family here?
That boy wants me to.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Will he be supervised?
What!
No! At least I don't think I am!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Jesus, what happened to you?
What happened?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Are you closed?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
What do you mean?
But they're all the same.
Slow down, huh?
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
No, he's not. You are.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
There's just one thing I want to know.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
It's for you.
Open it.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
You going to sit here all day?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Benefits?
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Well?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Here and there. Around.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Where did you get that thing?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Thanks. 
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Yeah, it might be.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Good thinking.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Well?
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Lettuce and tomato?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
I don't know.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
Now, Mister Gi...
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Closer to eight.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
Did you write that column?
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
You think so?
You always run with the well open?
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
And what's that?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Well...
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Are you absol...
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
I beg your pardon.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Upsy-daisy.
No --- how does it go?
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
What message?  What motorboat?
And where's he going to be?
With ME?
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
I'll say there is!
Jerry - there's another problem.
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Sugar?
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
What'll I tell him?
Are my seams straight?
Oh - Sugar!
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
You all right?
How's the bottle?
Not you, Sugar.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Yeah - Josephine.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Did he get fresh?
What for?
I always did.
Brand new.
It's about the Florida job.
We could pass for that.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Please.  It won't happen again.
About that roadhouse -
Daphne...
Another bridesmaid?
I don't like no witnesses.
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
We got it second-hand.
Really?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Yeah.
Men!
What's happened?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Why not?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Thank you.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Which one is yours - the big one?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
Would you mind moving along, please?
Guess!
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
Love it.  Which way?
What is it?
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Where's your shell collection?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
What thing?
I don't want to bore you.
Is that anything?
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
I think you're on the right track.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Really?
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Good evening, sir.
What'll it be, sir?
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
I should get going.
It was such a long time ago.
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Who’s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Crikey.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
You’re not even listening.
Hi. Hey.
What does your gut say?
No, count it, anyway.
Six thousand, right?
You quitting?
Not the way you’re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Would you grab my shampoo?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Subtle?
Are you sure?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
You pawned it.
Dad!
Yeah.
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
I am now, sir.
What is it you do again?
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
And you say all them people is dead now?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
It's cold, Daddy!
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Mornin', son...
You hurt, Daddy!?
From Miss Johnson --
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Who's winning, Mama?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
What is it, David Lee?
Good night, Mama...
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Night, son!
But, Nathan--
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Fuckin' a right.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
Is it Cartman's mom?
What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
I can't believe he's dead.
Come on, just get to the message board!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
Cartman?!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
What was that word, young man!?
Kyle?!
Look at that!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Viva la Resistance.
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Who is it?
SHIT!
That's gonna take a long time!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Nowhere.
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Stan!
WHAT?
Oh dear God...
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
I'm needing lunch.
We must take action on this immediately.
How is the children's progress?
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
You'd fuck your uncle!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Who's my cream puff?
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
You know I do.
What did you do today Satan?
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Ow, you're hurting me!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Getting drunk is no solution.
Anna...
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
So...
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
So, are you on for the next one?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
It's time we lock coordinates.
Look at this...Jesus.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
We're going to die.
We don't.
Yeah.  We did it.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Do you want some advice?
Dawn!  Dawn!
Oh my God.  What happened?
I'm not going with you.
And what are you going to do?!
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Thank you.
I'm going back for Taylor!
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
How is it looking, Mac?
You a mini-golfer?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
You have orange whips?
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Three whips. To go.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
I hate fuckin' opera.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
- canker sore.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Think he bought it?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
What's on your mind, Miles?
This scam we got going here was your 
Buzz Fazeli.
100 years! 
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Who gave it to you?
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
Theo.
What the fuck is this?
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
We ain't married no more.
My poor baby!
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
How's that?
I don't like to talk about it.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Junior.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Leave him alone!
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Like this?
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
What's your specialty?
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Business.
This is a vicious cycle.
Kinda tough on the butt.
Mind if I cut in?
Do I want you?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
You should.
Why did you come back?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Who identified the body?
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Fletcher!  Now!
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
Norman!
They told me about sixty hours.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Nobody move.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
But you've tested it?
Thirty yards.
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
What have you been told so far?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
How deep is he?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
They pressurize us with helium.
But sir --
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
You don't think weapons are important?
What for?
You think he killed Edmunds?
Going active.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
What caused it?
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Yes, sir.
How much damage?
It's chipped.
You don't know that.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
What?
She wired this system.
Some sort of lead or something.
We had considered it.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
How can he be missing?
What is that?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
We have a library?
What?  Why...
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
In Edmunds' things.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
You, me and Harry?
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
That wasn't in there before.
You don't believe me.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Diphenyl parlene.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
What is it, Norman?
It's getting cold.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Did you?
Someone did.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
You manifested that, Beth.
That's bullshit.
Beth!
Beth?
Get away from me!
How's that?
I don't get it.
Norman?  Where's Norman?
For who?  The fish?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
Then what is it?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Don't be defensive.
Nice work, Norman.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Wisconsin's your answer.
What is it?
Missed.
Hold on.
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
Good idea, Ted.
How are the others?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
You've heard of me?
He wasn't feeling well.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
What kind of a crash was it?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Well, we'll see...
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
Are you sure you don't need it?
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
Have you been checked out?
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I found it... It's just not there.
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
This isn't going to work.
Watch it!  Move back.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
And you?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Are you safe?
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Did you read her mind ?
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Are you alright ?
Johnny, this is Zander.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Or...?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
So ?
Where are you going ?
How do you feel about him now ?
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
Isn't it great to be in love ?
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
Are you the boy for me ?
I love you, Carmen.
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
You're late.
I'm gonna miss you.
Do you mean it ?
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
What ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
You used to dance...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Good good, then it's all settled.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Best in the Fleet !
Can you walk ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
Departure angle on viewer.
Yes.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
'Commander' Decker?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
What answers?
Not for us?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
That: in an act of...
Goodbye.
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
I <u>can</u>?
About <u>conflict</u>...
Hello.
Uh huh.
...lost the screw...
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Great.  Who is it...?
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Why?
That's right...
No, that's true.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
That's something a man could do...?
Lookit that, up already.
What am I gonna do?
What, what what are you doing here?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
We did...?
I have to tell you something...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
What courthouse?
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
It'll hurt the box office.
He's on the ph...
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Fourteen year old girls.
That's right.
They think it's your First Wife...
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Her...
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
What I...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
No.
This is Joe White.
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
What?
...I...
...I know...I know...
An artist of your caliber...
I know...
Hello.
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
...he's the producer of the movie.
Doug...
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Mmmm.  You have children?
I'm very sorry I...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace...
I want to make a good film.
I can't.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's lovely.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
I don't got the money.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
...not at all...
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
I'm gonna call him.
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
And don't tell her I told you.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I could help with the debate.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
This is my house too!
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
She still packing for her trip?
That doesn't bother me.
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
Great.  Big ears, too?
But you told us to starve.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
No.
So you're okay.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
So we'll...radiate some more?
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
Still, please.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
We don't have any coffee.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Machines do not EAT message.
Yeh?
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I have a snoop.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
You WHAT?
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Small world.
And you said...?
So.  Hopeful.
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's the same choice you made.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Thanks for coming out.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
But?  But what?
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
It's forever you know.
They're my kids.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
Out! Leave the table!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Hey.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
You know...Stanley...
Marty, ignore him.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Really? How many?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
So whaddya think?
No, you don't.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
Mom?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
We did the same thing last year also.
I can read it to you.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
What do you want?
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
The same. Same as what?
Scooby?
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Ni...
...gger.
OK.
Who is this?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
But...you called.
That's too bad.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Huh. Kids?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
You a pervert?
What for?
Prnceton.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Is he with the girl?
I said I'll lead.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
Let's move it we got company!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
Cooper...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Enjoying the tour so far?
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Well?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Good.
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
Can I have a glass of water?
Possibly some coffee?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
What about the President?
Go back to sleep, baby.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
You aren't sure!
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Yes, sir.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
How much soda, sir.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I don't think so, sir.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Have you tried the recall again?
Roger, maintain.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
War.
A through H is correct.
Check.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
They can't touch us at this height.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
Primary arming switch.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
That's what I said.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Yes, Major.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Maybe the warning system's out.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Sure, King.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Mn-hm.
Um-hm.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Stuck with what guy?
It's your birthday?
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
That sounds so depressing.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
A long, long, long, long, while.
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Really?
Hey, man.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Buff.
Hey! Hey.
Score! Yeah!
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Thanks. See man?
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
What's up guys?
Will you stand up for me?
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You rich?
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
I know. It's okay.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Oh, wow.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Hi.
Two-fifty.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
See ya later.
Yes.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
No.
No.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Nazeer what?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Of course I do!
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
What feelings?
Of course.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
What?
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
You did, huh? Good for you.
You really suck, you know that?
No, it's not...
Yeah.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Yeah, I crash there.
The prom. That's funny.
Now?
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
For a while.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Oh!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Yeah?
Just one?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Fuck.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
No.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
Madonna.
Yeah?
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
All of you!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Give me your coat.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
If I could be of any help...
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
I had a teacher like that once.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
He thinks it could be made into something.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
I was afraid of that.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Check.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
May I say you smell real special.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Hers.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Yes, I did.
What assistant?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
We've missed you too, dear.
I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Just a minute, you!
Are you or aren't you?
Who else ?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Well?
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
There sure is.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Don't bend back like that.
Hold me tighter.
You think this is all very funny.
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
What's the matter with you?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Did she read the script?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
Where are my cigarettes?
How did it go?
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
That's a lie!  They still want me!
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
This room has not been used for a long time.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
What doctor?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
A Storm Dragon?
Why did she have to show up now?
Maybe it was just an accident.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
When can I see, you again ?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
I'm not mad at you.
And now?
Wait. Don't leave me.
Finished your estimate?
What is it?
I know it.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Guess! Go on.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Can I give you a lift?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Why didn't you tell me?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
I can do that.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
She did that deliberately.
No thanks. You go on.
Lucy; come back!
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You're wasting your breath.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Tuesday.
Brad?
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
I can never get a way from it.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
How many sugars?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Man, what is this?
Wipe 'em out?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
How do you do that?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Anything.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
What terrific story?
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
How would you know?
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
It could make weather!
She's not his mama either.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
So?
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Jimmy, how's the -
Lois, what are you doing?
I do?
Maybe I could try --
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
I want to.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Hi.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
What else could I do?
Does Lois know about this yet?
A parka.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
It has everything.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
Shhhhhhh!
He flies as well, then . . .
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
What more?
Yes, but will you honor it?
General --- ?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
I've never been in a place like this before.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
No Paris?
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
And what do we get out of it?
Well, I don't understand.
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
What's he going to say?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
He's . . . cold. . .
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
I know, but  --
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
I'd like to.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Your bookie?
Not...gray.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
It wasn't a trick!
You're just jealous.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
What are you doing here?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
Your father was a sick weirdo.
This??
Bet he makes it.
Damn!  This will get him.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
What do you suggest, my dear?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
I don't understand.
You got wax in your ears?
You can't do this to me!
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
It's a ...baby.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Lara, please...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
I guess I got carried away
No! You couldn't imagine -
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Lois, the kickback story...
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
How much do you weigh?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
I broke the man out of prison --
I gave him this new face.
Please...
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes...fine.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
What happened?
Alison.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I don't know.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Your kids never cry.
From what?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
From you?
No.
What's vermin again?
Why?
Do you have a room?
When?
Tell me about the Ottos.
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Here we go.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
That's not news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
Do you have the blood test?
Yes.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
I'm a lawyer.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Are you a reporter?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
What time in the morning was this?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Yes.
You could see the speedometer?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
There wasn't time?
What do you remember about the accident?
What's that?
How do you like it, Nicole?
Do you like the colour?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
Will the police do anything to her?
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
Will you mind your own business!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Come on boys, break it up...
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
Is it news to you?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Not being partial, are you?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
I know Steve.  No.
He means that much to you...?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Could this be that boy?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
And where was his wife?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
This sort of thing!
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
You ought to be used to me by now.
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
J.J., if you think -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Does it hurt?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
I'll deal with the police.
Drive for a minute.
Is it dead?
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Mom?  You okay?
I got it.  Piece of cake.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Are you afraid?
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
I'm very sorry.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
You bet.
What?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Steve.
What's in those files?
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Of course.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Sure.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Steve Arnold...
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
What telegram?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
I'm sorry.
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
I've remembered something else...
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
So, you never heard of him.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Yes, Chuck?
Great.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
Do you understand?
And you're from the future too?
Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
You volunteered?
About what?
Thanks a lot.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
What's that?
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Why were the other two women killed?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Here, drink some of this...
Send a unit.
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
Admittedly...
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
I could fight you on this.
Are you finished?
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
This is nuts.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Please...
There's a ladder here.
You're the one who started running.
That one did.
That's a lie...
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
They won't...
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
I have to get to the airport...
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
You need anything?
It doesn't matter...
Who?
Slow down, take a breath...
How did those... ?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
What?
Really?
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
I'll explain someday.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
May I make two suggestions... ?
Physical?
Get rid of them.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
I need the police.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Dinner's in the oven.
What makes you ask?
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
What?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Anything wrong... ?
Nicholas...
How concerned should I be?
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Just what I told you.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
Nell --
Nell!
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
All right...
Welcome Home.
I don't know.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
What'll happen to us, Nell?
What happened?
When do we take the tests?
Yes.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
No.
David.
Theo... Did you?
That's so sad.
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Not for you, clearly.
As soon as you get dressed.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
No.
Hey.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
What.
CQ what?
Boomerang.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
What?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Here, are you always this sarky?
Oh, it just ended, then.
Disappointed.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
-- Your employer?
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
How far?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Hey.
Which kind?
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
What?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
I don't get it.
How'd you get in here.
He's expecting you?
You know her?
Exercising my visitation rights.
I miss my kids.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Hello, Ed.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Ann--
Ann--
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Rachel.
Hello, Mr Crane.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
But more or less.
...I guess I've been all wet.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Please, Ed.
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
Where you going?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Honey.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
...I don't get it.
Not guilty, your honor...
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
...Probity.
I don't work here. My wife does.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Frank.
...You ever wonder about it?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
...We goin'?
...I'm Crane.
Hello!
Yes, sir.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Forget it!
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
We need light in here, stat.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
This place is a maze.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Lieutenant!  It's me.
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
What's that?
What are we talking about here?
Curious.  There's something missing.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Something tried to get into this room!
Where is that?
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
What's that?
You work here?
What do you do?
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
They've got something.
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
What?
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
What kind of egg is it?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't understand.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Where would we find it?
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
Dr. Green...
They're all heavily armed.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
Hide quickly!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
Help someone!
I don't believe it.
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
Why is he in the basement?
What happened down there?
Cue music...
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
Who are you?
Sure she would.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
No.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
Where have you been?
Every time you and Marlon--
What're you doing down here?
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
What's the hurry?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
How are you, Mother?
How's your hip?
It looks so small.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Do you live around here?
Poopy day?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
How can this be?
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Who called this meeting?
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
I'm looking for him.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
Do I know you?
And what's that?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
I think you're full of shit.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You know my work?
I'll know soon enough.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
That would be my guess.
You've been using me --
Mulder -- it's me --
I'm on the roof.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Jesus, Mulder...
Now what?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Scully...
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Why?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
What are you implying, Scully?
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
What kind of infection?
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
What are my choices?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
This virus -- it... 
Been where?
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Is she alive?
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
You're lying.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
Let me out. Stop the car.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
Sing a song of sixpence...
Miriam...
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I do it all the time!
Damn him.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
What about Julia?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
Where the hell are we?
You sure about this?
Thank you.
Oh no... No you don't.
Intravenous administration complete.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Instead of going into his mind...
When did he lapse into the coma?
Catherine!
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
So?
I need it.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
No.
...at all.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Gestern bein heurigen...
...to steal my girl.
...and buried him.
Wer ist da?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
How do you know?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
That's his headache.
...quarrel?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
That's the reason.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
He works in a military hospital.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Yes.
Can you tell me whose...
You a friend of Lime's?
Been here long?
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Get the next plane.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Do you see what that means?
So would I.
...in the morning.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Win what?
What time is it?
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
...of Santa Fe."
Do you know his number?
...his number.
Mr. Crabbin.
Hmm.
Did the police believe you?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You really liked it?
...the best way one can, you know.
Thank you.
Find out?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Something wrong.
No.
...Mr. Martins?
Passport, please.
Did you sleep well?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
You will.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Who's Linda?
When can I see you?
How come there's no punctuation?
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
I want to learn to read it.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Where are they?
The sex is better.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
An investment banking house.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
You wouldn't announce it?
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
And? WHat did you notice?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Who? How would I know him?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
How do you reconcile the two?
Who killed Manzetti?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
I don't do that.
Don't tell me what I --
Do you feel you're making progress here?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Hello...?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
Oh, what is this shit?
It's not going to be fine. It's --
When do you want it to go off?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
You remember Miriam....
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
Howard Stern.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
You're going to live here permanently?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Are you going to keep it?
Does he know?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
You're leaving?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
It can't be true!
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
The Mamma's there too.
What else is there?
Because you'd laugh.
He can learn.  He is learning.
... Not yet.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Enzo, wake up!
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Why?
Can I come in?
He doesn't like us.
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
... How long was I asleep?
I'm concentrating.
No!  I would never cheat you.
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Please, have a seat.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
You look adorable.
How can you tell it's a female?
How are you?
What's wrong?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Assassin!
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
You two know each other?
So don't show a picture.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Anything else?
Cool. What's it do?
How do we bypass it?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
So, how was I?
I wasn't too over the top?
You okay?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
This is for "mama and the kids."
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Sure.
I'm sick.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head —- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ——
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ——
Oh, that's so interesting!
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
It could be a man.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
Tormented -- ? Why?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Get it out of here!
Who was the other man?
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
I can use them.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn’t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
I found this at your brother’s.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You lost my money?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
When did you get back?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don’t learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn’t suit you! Who knew I’d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who’d want to make sure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands?
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
You’re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he’d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don’t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didn’t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
I don’t.
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
Where is that?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
The word for those things is croissants.
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
What...?
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
I’m calling about the puppies.
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
On the bed!
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Oh... We split up.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Carlos De Moraes?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Clients come and go.
You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?
Maybe I don’t.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
It’s wet. Will this do?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Who else knows about the boy?
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Gluck.
Five seconds. Then you die.
So why didn’t he?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
What do you mean?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Better today than tomorrow.
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne, stop it!
What did they say?
I'll go.
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
I am ready now...
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
Go onto the next question.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
And?
No, I... I held it up to...
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
God defeated the English, not me.
Really?
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
So how would you put it?
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
5,000 gold crowns.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
So... what is the message?
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
What's going on?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Stand by with the battering-rams...
Well...?  Shall we go?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
You don't believe me anymore?
How many did he give you?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I don't know... I thought...
I... I never lied!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Why would they?
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
"Love your enemies"...
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Are you going to leave me too?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
I don't want to wait for his call.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Hello.
How long have you been married?
And how's Yurek?
When's your baby due?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'm on the run!
Funny time to say this.
wish I knew you better.
We're recruiting.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
And suppose they take the table away?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
Boys, boys...
I know.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
What did you pay him?
I can look after myself!
What are you reading?
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Out of Warsaw.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
Where are you hiding?
What's all that gunfire?
What's happening?
Careful! Watch his hand.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
Ohhh I've never been there. 
I worry for you.
What's he say?
No, words. You have never heard words?
Everyone has to practice.
What did she say?
What?
What on?
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Mama.
You the owner here?
All right if I look around your lobby?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
You're late.  Where you been?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
I thought you blew all your money.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
How'd ya do?
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
You think he'll show?
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
You beat him, kid.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
What's the problem?
See and raise five.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
My end was only one.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
Hooker!
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
What is this?  I got work to do.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
What's your next step, Nick?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Cheer up, darling.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
What?
How are you?
Well!
And don't ever try to see me again.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
Another Martini --
You know, we know each other.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Your father?
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
There. 
She fell down.
Don't lie to me.
Hello, Dorothy. 
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
This is my wedding.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
That woman!
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
This gun yours?
So would I.
Well, what'd you think?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Are you kidding?
Well....
About three.
Have a shot?
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I'll get some.
I know.
Chris!
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
I can't! I haven't got it!
I never had it.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Oh, please, Nick.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
But he has nothing to do with it!
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
So it's you he was after!
You got types?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
You're a fine watch dog.
I never saw that before.
Aren't you hot in that?
Did I give it to you?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
What are you going to do?
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You bet I wouldn't.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Back to California
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Wynant's body?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I wish you'd tell me who.
You worked here?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
I just wanted to tell you...
Where are you going?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Where were you going?
What's in the other direction?
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
Paper.
What's it say?
A casual one.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
We've got rope?
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Get off him.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Just keep quiet.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Take the binoculars.
They're not going to--
You can't tell anybody about this.
What do we do with the Humvee?
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
There's a way.
This.  Whatever it is.
You're not losing trust, are you?
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
Where the hell is it!?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Get up and dig.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
What the hell took so long.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
No.
No.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sorry.
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
Getting cold.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
What do you figure it is?
To where?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Epps.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Woods.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
He says it's a box.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You will.  You'll get it.
Jaeger?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
We...we could go home with something else.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
Iraqis.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Think we can make it?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
You're going to burn up in those.
Drug evasion with....
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
I have to... he's a G-34
Then why did you bring it up?
I haven't done anything.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
What are you doing?
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
It's the end.
THX!
I've got it!  Astounding!
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
I don't know.
Yes.
Yes.
Hey, that's the guy-
How's the print coming?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Treat. We treat devices.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
It's working.
How do you know?
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Good, now the other side.
Something round, two wires ...
You got it.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Computer device?
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Alright!
What is that?
What's the matter?
No... No more killing.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
Prints?
How're you guys doing?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Pooch, can you move it?
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
What was it this time?
P.E.T.N ...
T.J., what're you doing?
I'll do it.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Sir...
It's our only option.
Yes.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
Eleven o'clock! 
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
No.
But--
And harems ... ?
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
I hope you find the figures correct.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Thank you, Major. 
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Disappointed?
The pepper, too?
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Two fifty-three, five--
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
And you--
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
What shade of powder do you use?
That's too dark.
Do you know my first name?
Beautiful specimen.
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
It's disgraceful!
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Marvelous.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
And you're going to fall for them.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Ah, let me have a little fun.
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Lovely.
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
I beg your pardon!
Your bag?
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
You're certain?
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
None of the stewards have seen her.
She's not on the starboard side either.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
What could possible be funny?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
How cold?
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
What's this?
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
A whole ten cents?!
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
It's bad.
Now it's worse.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
Never let go.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Yes sir.
April 14, 1912.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Feeling a little better, I see.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Isn't she lovely?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
You'll excuse me. 
Will you pardon me?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
How about a little game later?
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
Nice lines--
You've got lipstick all over you.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Married?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
A little.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Don't let's talk about it.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
We coulda got two third-class!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
You don't think--?
A dollar forty.
Not a chance.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
My change.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
How about you?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
I'll go with you.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's too bad.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Am I a member of this club?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Why--don't you like him?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Very good, Mary--
What's the matter, Mary?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
I went for four.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
--you'd go with him!
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
Congratulations.
There you are, sir.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
I'll explain later--
Ain't got time.
Oh, my God...
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
A peace officer... Impressive man
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
I want them spitting blood!
Come on, you...
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Forget it.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Age quod agis.
That's just my game.
On three?  You call it.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
You don't even know him.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Not exactly...
Doc!  How the hell are you?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Satisfied?
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
Fun though, wasn't it?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Just answer.
Just doesn't, that's all.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Well hello, Sherm.
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
I don't like it.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
How you doin', boy?
That a fact?
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
But -
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
How did you get this number?
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
I'm sure they will.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Q! How are you?
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Paris -
... Shoelaces?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
She married a hockey player.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
They point, I shoot.
No.
Boyfriend?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Nice to run into you again.
No?
And what do you call this?
Why don't we just take these -
Blood or Dutch?
Sometimes you just have to -
Sleep well?
And when might that be?
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
Sorry I'm late -
Sakwa!
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
What is HE doing here?
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Please sir. Please -
I pay my own way.
What did your wife get her?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Your feet are cold.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You're always taking his side.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
I have someone I want you to meet.
What's the problem here?
Good afternoon, ladies.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Toy?
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
THAT is Sid!
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Right?  Buddy?
According to my nava-computer, the --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Spaceship.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Hold on, Woody!
Great!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
I dunno.
Hey!!
No she's NOT --
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
You are a liar!
No!  No, no, no, no!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
It's Sid!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Woody?!
Woody!  Speed up!
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Surely she is older?
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
Why does he need money?
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
I think she's lying.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Oh, it is?
My Leica's gone.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
Did you tell Dad?
Hi.
What's up?
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
In school?
Private?
How are your grades?
You do?  What else you do?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
She knows Arnie Metzger.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
That's good coke.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
What's he doing up here?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Somewhere safe.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
What's your name?
One question.  How did you find about this?
What is the name of your informant?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
I got money.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
Twenty thousand.
For fuck's sake.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Where's that?
Great.
I don't see why not.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Can I see you again?
Yes.
You're too young.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Clear?
But try too hard --
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
Screenwriter?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
You don't know, do you?
The park?
Who wrote it?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
You know.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
No, I don't think so.
How's it going with Gail?
We go for a walk.
Qual se tu?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Following new course. Warp seven.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
What are you doing?
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Spock.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
Is it possible?
Spock.
Who are you?
No... I didn't.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
I don't understand...
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok, we must find a way...
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
My dinner.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
What for?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
I'm your program?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
User requests are what computers are for.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
You're alive!
A User -- in our world?
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Watch it!
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
But-what if I can't...?
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
Yori... hey...
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
My quarters.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Where are you going?
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
What's this for?
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Just hang a minute.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She could be telling the truth.
Any minute now.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
Hello, Harry.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
What did happen?
Why did you continue to see him?
Not because you were attracted to him?
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
My husband can't know about this.
Natasha?
What were you doing there?
I don't take those assignments.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
No.  But I wanted to.
What is it?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
You working on someone right now?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Boris and Doris?
Hello?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
Did you get the letter?
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
I didn't get any chicken.
Tell him we gotta go.
Bye-bye.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
You know when you sat behind me?
What did he do to Arlene?
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
No no no no no no no no no...
Is this a joke?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Naw naw!
Yeah.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Clarence?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
I'm a married man.
What?
That's a pretty amazing story.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Is he big league?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
I'd fuck Elvis.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
He wants to talk ya.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Don't you?
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
I'm really not very -
I really don't know.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I've seen him.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Do you believe him?
But a fuckin' baggie.
Or a bit player -
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
Suspect's words -
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
Preach on, Big D.
Put it in your pants.
Sorta room-mates?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Well?
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
What kind of information?
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
It's just a shot to calm you.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
They're keeping an eye on me.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
Mason???
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
Just like that?  You were in prison?
You want me to rob him?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
What are you talking about???
JOSE!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
You have him in restraints.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Hey!  You there!
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
Oh, Jesus.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
Where to?
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
You own this place?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
What time is it now?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Two-hundred.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
We ain't got no Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Taking a little trip?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
Do you have to call me that?
I got it.
Wasn't nothing.
It's nothing.  Really.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Where you coming from?
Where'd you learn to do that?
My face tell you all that?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
How far is it to California?
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
Let's do it here.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
I shot him.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
John, throw me the keys.
The trunk.  It's locked.
What happened to your hand?
Where you headed?
Hey!
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Nice office you've got.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
No.
Shut up.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Jake--
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
Nooo!
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
I wasn't doing anything.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
What the fuck do you want?
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
California...
Wait a second--
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I'm not rambling.
How much could you get?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
So?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Great!
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
No charge.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
I got it.
Accident.
You're not from around here, are you?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
My face tell you all that?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
What about us?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Why?
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
I busted my leg!
<u>Jake</u>...
That's a nasty cut you got there.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
The old lady?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
I axed you a question.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Proceed.
Once again please?
I don't think I got the job in New York.
Is Jeremy okay?
Okay.
I remember you.
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
...I think rust.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Just give me a minute.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Yes.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
When?
I'm going to work out.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
You like sports?
Did you get up from your seat?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
...I got a present for you.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
You told them cowboys you had it.
He said...
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Yeah?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
They really got all that money, them whores?
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Like I said, I...
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
A sign on him?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Been gone near three years now.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Shit!
Did... you... get... him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
That was... the first one.
I trust you, Bill.
Wha... what f-for?
You could have it. All of it.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
She gave me the evil eye.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
HEY.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I seen him.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Who's he?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Say, Ned... ?
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
What was the money for?
Keyser Soze
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Come home, Dean.
I know who he is.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
What the hell do you want?
How are they going to do it?
No killing?
What is this?
Keaton, I can't just -
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
What did you say?
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
A little of both.
What do you mean I can't see him?
When does he post bail?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
You got him wrong.
I don't know about that.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
So this lawyer...
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
Then what?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
Edie...
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
You're joking.
Four cases in three years ...
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Yes.
... he wants to testify ...?
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Objection!
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
How is that?
What book is that?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
I do.  Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
She getting good care over there?
I didn't do too well for you.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
And you wrote that...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I read the hospital report on your client.
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
Who are you protecting, then?
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
This is Miss Costello...?
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
D'you find an apartment?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Not if you don't grow up...
Thank you.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
I have to talk to you.
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...he's a good man...
...I have to stand up for her...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...four years ago...
... I understand ...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
I want to buy you a drink.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
He won't talk.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Nothing.
You.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
I told you! Right here!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
I like that one.
Scottie, what are you doing?
Where shall we go for dinner?
Can't you see?
Why?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Scottie, please...!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
I made it.
What are you going to do?
Love me... keep me safe...
You don't remember.
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
When?
Oh... wandering about.
Please drink your coffee.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
I hope we will, too.
Good-bye.
No.
How can you be sure?
And no birds sing.
Where?
Where were you born?
How do you know?
There's a name on the gravestone.
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Tell me.
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
My love... because I love you.
Why?
Where?
You believe that I love you?
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Ow!!
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. Everybody tells me.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Could be.
My... the acrophobia.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Easy, now.
Johnny!
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
The poor thing....
Out. I've got things to do.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
Well...
She's fucking hot!
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
The floor was wet. She slipped!
What did you say?
More.
What do you think you are doing?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Fuck you Boyd!
Who? What are you talking about?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
I won't do it.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
Have you thought about what I said?
So. When is the wedding.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
What is it?
She's not here.
No I don't.
Your investment ideas never work out.
I don't think so Boyd.
But not tonight.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
He's too drunk.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
He's cracked up.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
Whatever you say Kojak.
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
May we have the rings please?
This is ridiculous.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
He's a great chef.
Time out.
Seating problems.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Not padded ones.
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Do you love me?
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Where are you?
How late?
What okay?
The chairs.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
I know.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
Who's dead?
So what do we do?
No...
But...
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I'll take a ride.
Where did you get that?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
The post-Vegas Man.
She's dead.
I'll come to you tonight.
Give them to Refugio.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Stop this, stop this.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
How did you know about that?
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
How much is that?
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Ramona! Ramona!
What's the matter with you?
She's mad.
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
How are you today?
You'll soon find out, you liar!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
There's been an accident.
Yes -- very, very big!
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
What happened to me?
Have I slept long?
How did you see me?
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
I should have told him.
What's the assignment?
What happens if I can't catch him?
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
You know how much man power you're talking about?
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
My God...
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
What are you doing?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
Who said that?
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
We know you didn't kill those guards.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
See something?
Nice work.
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now.  Why are you going to do this?
Then shoot him already.
Where's John?
The symphony of collision...
What about it?
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
Mr. President, this is St...
...mmm?
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
...where?
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
When do we bring'em back?
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
What crisis?
<u>Do</u> it...
Tell, tell, tell me again.
...you want us to go to War...
What do you know about them?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
Our adopted land...

No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
He thinks it's too...
How's your wife?
Give'em another pill...
Courage, Mom.
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
...where is my pill?
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Would you go to War to do that? 
...why?
Do I know you?
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
What do you want the kid to say?
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
What?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
I think it's fine?
In the Folk Music Section.
...this the Guy.
What?
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
The Albanian Campaign.
An anti-psychotic...
...what happened...?
No, I didn't think so.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
...as of today, 89% favorable.
The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?
Why a beret?
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
... That's what you told us to say.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Know the name?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Hello Bud.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Where is it?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
I don't.
Do you think you're ready?
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
How you doing Buddy?
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
But?
Anybody want another drink?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Yes, I guess you're right
And uh, your nicotine sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
We're all here, and ready sir!
Hello?
No Jonathan.
Come on.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Oh that explains everything.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Anyone else not coming?
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
That was very good.
He loves you very much.  He just--
Are you mad at me?
I started seeing things.
Who's idea was it?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
What?
Are you humoring me?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
She said, "You know."  That I know.
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
That can't feel good.
Who?
You're the flower lady.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Hello?
I wanted to apologize.
Your house is so beautiful.
No.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Mrs. Frank?
Why are you here?
Wow.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Jody--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Absolutely.
You think he killed her?
Seance.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Are you okay?
What?
Adamant?
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I'm a terrible friend.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
What's their name?
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Tired?
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Of what?
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Hi.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
"...for my father."
Sorry.  You understand.
Our house.
Where is she then?
See?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
When?
...like it never even happened...
Who did?
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
Do I have everything?
You know I am.
You don't remember?
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
I take it your not mad at me.
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
That's not what I'm sayi--
Adamant.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
I don't believe you.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I don't want the -
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
Do not tell me that!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Only you...
What is wrong...?
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Oh god...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
Harder...
you're very --- different.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Rowan...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
She - she said I - I was a ---
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
What about your work back home...?
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
When aid you get home last night...?
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
You okay...?
I'm getting --- left behind.
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Rowan Mayfair.
I heard something like that
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
All the time?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Do you take sugar?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Sugar?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
then why did you marry her -
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
First finish your tea...
Why did you let him in?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Is LESLIE here?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Just put it in my room
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
See? Did you see that?
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
Get them together.
You got everything you ever wanted.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Whatever helps you cope.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Finally, some gratitude.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
You're on the next plane home.
My legacy.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
My new bike.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
And then what?
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That's probably my office.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
I see.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You do like girls, don't you?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You were the new and improved you.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
In a hurry, are we?
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
How you doing, Artie?
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
How soon can we get something?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Maybe she used another name.
I don't know what to say...
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
Yes.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
I want a full-scale investigation.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Ms. Toller?
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Thank you, Jimmy.
I say something funny?
Excuse me?
Okay, what's the matter?
Kelly.  What is it?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
Hello?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Say you love me.
But check this...
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
I just want my life back...
Where is she?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Sam, for godsake.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Yes.
Yes.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Jesus, man... You okay?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
What?
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
How...
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
But don't pull that again.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Jim, are you all right?
You might have mentioned you had that.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
What is that?
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
It was in your book.
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
You've... done... this... before.
She's perfectly safe.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
You're not that big.
Easy now.
Dr. Pemberton?
Are you all right?
Well?
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
She's in love.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Watch it!
Dada, what's a daikini?
What do you want!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
But what am I gonna transform??
What'd you bit me for!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
How??
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
I'm not going in there.
Get back here, Rool!
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
She's hungry.
This is not going well.
Obviously.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Nail it!
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
He was... like him.
Have you got your gun on now?
So one of them got to him.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Just us.
Who else knows?
Where are you taking us?
Whacking?
But why would they murder...
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
But why?
How long?
The... bullets?
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I'm coming.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
That has no place in this house.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
No, Rachel...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
She say where he is?
I wish dawdie was with us.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
...didn't you?
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
...Toto, too?
...room --
...paper?
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
And him a brain.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
They're coming back!
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oil can what?
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Oh --
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Yeah.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Where do we go now?
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
You don't get around us that easy!
...Tin Man!
...junk!
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
No, sir!
Come on -- come on --
Oh, did - did you see that?
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Yeah --
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
You new?
What happened to Len Tashka?
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
Nuclear.
The King pipeline.
Is there another way?
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Construction’s not exactly my line.
Old friend?
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Your last chance. Take the money.
The name?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
What the hell are you doing here?
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
What are you talking about?
I’m coming with you.
I could have given you the world.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Was this all about the oil?
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
Valentin Zukovsky.
See?  You’re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
The Maiden’s Tower.
What is this place?
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
The parcel’s in the post.
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
What about our end?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Hi, Jon.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Blake?  Dead?
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
Jon --
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
I¹m not.
Damn straight.
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
His what?
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What the hell -- ?
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
What?
Dan -- what do we do now?
So do I.  So do you.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Where's Laurie?
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
I can fix it.
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
No comment.
Their real names, please.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
What about you?
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Who the hell are you?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
Not bad for a gimp.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
What game is that?
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Who are you?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
What are you?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yorgi and Kirill.
You okay?
He's shut out the communication circuit!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
What's so damn funny?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Help me with this guy.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
That was for Anders.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
I wish I could go.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Are you all right?
I'll tell you one thing though.
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
Logan, do you see this ring?
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
The intention of registration act -
What are you going to do?
Who?
How?
You designed this yourself?
He helped you?
I lost him.
Is it enough?
I'll find him.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Oh, shit.
Frederick Frankenstein?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
MMMmm!
Will you miss me?
I hope you like large weddings.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Are you suggesting I call him master???
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Dr. Frankenstein?
I didn't do that.
One week at the most!?
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Vermicelli.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Aye-gor!
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
Did you see anyone else down here?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
What a filthy job!
How?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Do you have the name I wrote down?
That's not bad.
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
More, do you hear me?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
But you did -- I just heard it.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Original.
All right -- where is she?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Get the sedative ready!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
Extremely well.
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Would you like a sandwich?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
Right here?
Reputation.  Reputation!
It wasn't me.
Do you think you can sing it?
I'd be so nervous.
Good night, Doctor.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I know.
How do you know they're done?
Three minutes to go!
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Drink!
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
